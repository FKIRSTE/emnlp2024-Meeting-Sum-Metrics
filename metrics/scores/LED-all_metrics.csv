"The group discussed the first version of the Bayes-net used to work out a user's intentions when asking for directions from a navigation device. Three intentions were identified: Vista (to view), Enter (to visit) and Tango (to approach). The structure of the belief-net comprises, firstly, a feature layer, which includes linguistic, discourse and world knowledge information that can be gleaned from the data. It is possible for these variables to form thematic clusters( eg ""entrance"", ""type of object"", ""verb""), each one with a separate middle layer.  At this stage, all the actual probabilities are ad-hoc and hand-coded. However, there has been progress in the design and organisation of experiments, that will eventually provide data more useful and appropriate for this task.";"This was the first presentation of the JavaBayes project.
It was about the search for the middle layer of the network.
The group discussed the admission fee, the time of day, and the location of the building.
The team also discussed the probability distribution, which was not set, and how to interpret it.
Finally, the group talked about how to make it easier for the participants to enter the building, and whether or not they should pay admission fee.
Then, the discussion turned to the topic of the discourse, which the group thought was important.";0.2805429864253393;0.0639269406392694;0.1719457013574661;0.2081447963800905;0.8604123592376709;0.8276334404945374;0.8437047004699707;0.0336455866191896;0.12880338912145675;0.6678646640021065;0.7124183006535948;109;153;19.682241439819336;19.682241439819336;;0.0379746835443038;0.0126582278481012;86.51592585205212;36.71664013345854;1.6735319224326763;8.987961044844804;99.48842743309814;0.0498474937582753;0.0932676757502397;0.0064273117663109;1;4;1;3;1;5;1;3;1;4;1;3;1;2;1;2;1;3;1;2;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;1;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;1;1
The group members mainly talked about the details of the belief-net framework. They first discussed the way to make the definition of user and situation clear and set up the standards, e.g., user thrift, based on user's budget. Then they turned to the discussion about endpoint decision. They mentioned approaches including setting features/modes of like selling, fixing and exhibiting, and this inspired the group members to design user compatibility nodes of which value would depend on the user status and situation. They further discussed Go-there decision, which is related to the previous idea using the similar set of the ontologies. Finally, they shifted the topic to different probability computation methods for belief-nets and thought of solutions to issues with limited data annotation.;"The meeting was mainly about the design of the belief-net and the decision nodes.
Firstly, the group discussed the decision node, which was based on the user model.

"The meeting was taken up by discussion about a thesis proposal and a talk about to take place at EML. It was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy. Base constructions deal with the norm, while further general domain mechanisms determine how the constructions are invoked depending on the context. Several potential examples of polysemy were discussed in detail: ""walk/run into"", ""on the bus"", ""out of film"", ""where is X?"". However, none of them was an example of lexical polysemy resolved by construal straightforward enough to include in the proposal; the tourist domain is not metaphor rich.";"The meeting began with a discussion about the project proposal.
The team discussed the construction of the building, the model, and how it would be implemented.
Then, the team talked about the model.
The model was based on the model of a building, and the model would be based on its construction and model.

The team was coming close to finalizing the model for Aurora. They were still trying to make some improvements to improve their score. The team began with a discussion about how reverberation could be better accounted for. The professor thought that experimenting with different filters could help achieve a better signal-to-noise ratio. The new system for estimating silence probabilities that the team had added to the model was very effective, but it created a 220ms latency in the VAD. The team was not sure what kinds of constraints would be placed on latency eventually. They wanted to play it safe.

This is the second meeting of the design group. Project Manager introduced new project requirements at first. The management required a remote control only for television and aimed at customers under 40. In terms of user interface design, User Interface focused on user-friendliness but still thought multi-function should be considered. Industrial Designer agreed and proposed to substitute voice recognition for the ten digits. He also suggested that they should use infrared so that the remote control could be connected with most TV sets. After that, in order to solve the problem of energy source, the team decided to include a cradle so that the remote control could be recharged.;"This was the second meeting of Project Manager's second meeting with Industrial Designer, User Interface, Marketing, Industrial Designer and Industrial Designer.
The meeting was mainly focused on the technical design of the remote control.
Industrial Designer introduced the new project requirements.
User Interface suggested that the remote should be simple and easy to use and the buttons should be elaborate on the inside.
Then Industrial Designer suggested that they could use a cheap circuit board and a rechargeable battery.

This is the fourth meeting of the design group. The group firstly introduced a prototype which contained the characteristics determined at the last meeting. Then Project Manager pointed out that since the production costs were over budget, they should reduce costs by leaving out solar cells, not using voice recognition and changing the button material into plastics. Then the group went through the evaluation criteria of the product. They thought the remote control should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, easy to find and spongy and evaluated the prototype with these criteria. When evaluating the project, the group considered that it was tempered by the choice of components and the price. Eventually, the group decided to redesign the product.;"The meeting was mainly about the design of the remote control.
