"Grad C : Nice .
Grad D : OK .
Grad A : to {disfmarker} to handle .
Grad D : Is that good ?
Grad C : Right . Yeah , I 've have never handled them .
Grad B : Goats eat cans , to my understanding . Tin cans .
Grad D : Did we need to do these things ?
Grad C : Wow .
Grad D : OK .
Grad B : Could I hit {disfmarker} hit F - seven to do that ? on the {disfmarker} Robert ?
Grad A : I 'm
Grad B : Oh , the remote will do it OK .
Grad D : OK .
Grad B : Cuz I 'm already up there ?
Grad A : in control here .
Grad B : You are in control . Already ?
Grad D : Wow , we 're all so high tech here . Yet another p PowerPoint presentation .
Grad B : I {disfmarker} Well it makes it easier {pause} to do
Grad D : Certainly does .
Grad B : So , {pause} we were {disfmarker} Ah !
Grad C : Johno , where are you ?
Grad B : OK . So , Let 's see . Which one of these buttons will do this for me ? Aha ! OK .
Grad C : Should you go back to the first one ?
Grad B : Do I wanna go back to the first one ?
Grad C : Well {disfmarker}
Grad B : OK .
Grad D : I 'm sorry I {disfmarker}
Grad C : Well , I mean , {pause} just to {disfmarker}
Grad B : OK . Introduce .
Grad D : OK .
Grad C : Yeah , um {vocalsound} Well , "" the search for the middle layer "" . It 's basically uh talks about uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It just refers to the fact that uh {pause} one of main things we had to do was to {pause} decide what the intermediate sort of nodes were ,
Grad D : I can read ! I 'm kidding .
Grad C : you know , because {disfmarker}
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad A : But if you really want to find out what it 's about you have to {pause} click on the little {pause} light bulb .
Grad B : Although I 've {disfmarker} I 've never {disfmarker} I don't know what the light bulb is for . I didn't i install that into my {pause} PowerPoint presentation .
Grad A : It opens the Assistant that tells you that the font type is too small .
Grad B : Ah .
Grad A : Do you wanna try ?
Grad D : Ach u
Grad B : I 'd prefer not to .
Grad A : OK . Continue .
Grad D : It 's a needless good idea . Is that the idea ?
Grad A : Why are you doing this in this mode and not in the presentation mode ?
Grad D : OK .
Grad B : Because I 'm gonna switch to the JavaBayes program
Grad A : Oh ! OK . Of course . Mm - hmm .
Grad B : and then {pause} if I do that it 'll mess everything up .
Grad D : I was wondering .
Grad B : Is that OK ?
Grad D : Yeah , it 's OK .
Grad A : Sure .
Grad C : Can you maximize the window ?
Grad D : Proceed .
Grad B : You want me to {disfmarker} Wait , what do you want me to do ?
Grad C : Can you maximize the window so all that stuff on the side isn't {disfmarker} doesn't appear ?
Grad A : No , It 's OK . It 's {disfmarker} It 'll work .
Grad B : Well I can do that , but then I have to end the presentation in the middle so I can go back to open up
Grad C : OK , fine .
Grad B : Here , let 's see if I can {disfmarker}
Grad C : Alright .
Grad D : Very nice .
Grad B : Is that better ? OK .
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad B : Uh {disfmarker} I 'll also get rid of this "" Click to add notes "" . OK .
Grad D : Perfect .
Grad B : So then the features we decided {disfmarker} or we decided we were {disfmarker} talked about , right ? Uh the {disfmarker} the prosody , the discourse , {pause} verb choice . You know . We had a list of things like "" to go "" and "" to visit "" and what not . The "" landmark - iness "" of uh {disfmarker} I knew you 'd like that .
Grad D : Nice coinage .
Grad B : Thank you . uh , of a {disfmarker} of a building . Whether the and this i we actually have a separate feature but I decided to put it on the same line {pause} for space . "" Nice walls "" {vocalsound} which we can look up because I mean if you 're gonna {pause} get real close to a building in the Tango mode , right , there 's gotta be a reason for it . And it 's either because you 're in route to something else or you wanna look at the walls . The context , which in this case we 've limited to {pause} "" business person "" , "" tourist "" , or {pause} "" unknown "" , the time of day , and "" open to suggestions "" , isn't actually a feature . It 's {pause} "" We are open to suggestions . ""
Grad D : Right . can I just ask the nice walls part of it is that {vocalsound} uh , in this particular domain {disfmarker} you said {disfmarker} be {disfmarker} i it could be on two different lines but are you saying that in this particular domain it happens the {disfmarker} that landmark - iness cor is correlated with
Grad B : Oh {disfmarker}
Grad C : No . We have a separate
Grad B : They 're separate things .
Grad C : feature .
Grad D : their being nice w
Grad B : Yeah .
Grad D : OK .
Grad B : I either could put "" nice walls "" on its own line or "" open to suggestions "" off the slide .
Grad C : Like you could have a p
Grad D : And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} By "" nice "" you mean {disfmarker}
Grad C : You {disfmarker} Like you could have a post office with uh {disfmarker} you know , nice murals or something .
Grad B : Right .
Grad D : OK .
Grad B : Or one time I was at this {disfmarker}
Grad D : So "" nice walls "" is a stand in for like architecturally it , uh {disfmarker} significant
Grad B : But see the thing is , if it 's {disfmarker}
Grad C : Architecturally appealing from the outside .
Grad D : or something like that . OK .
Grad B : Yeah but if it 's architecturally significant you might be able to see it from {disfmarker} Like you m might be able to "" Vista "" it ,
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : right ? And be able to {disfmarker}
Grad A : Appreciate it .
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : Yeah , versus , like , I was at this place in Europe where they had little carvings of , like , dead people on the walls or something .
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : I don't remember w
Grad D : Uh - huh .
Grad B : It was a long time ago .
Grad D : There 's a lot of those .
Grad B : But if you looked at it real close , you could see the {disfmarker} the in intricacy of the {disfmarker} of the walls .
Grad D : OK . So that count as {disfmarker} counts as a nice wall .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : Right .
Grad D : The {disfmarker} OK . Right .
Grad A : The {disfmarker}
Grad D : Something you want to inspect at close range {pause} because it 's interesting .
Grad B : Exactly .
Grad D : OK .
Grad A : Hmm .
Grad B : Robert ?
Grad A : Well there {disfmarker} there is a term {pause} that 's often used . That 's "" saliency "" , or the "" salience "" of an object . And I was just wondering whether that 's the same as what you describe as "" landmark - iness "" . But it 's really not . I mean an object can be very salient
Grad D : Hmm .
Grad A : but not a landmark at all .
Grad D : Not a landmark at all . There 's landmark for um , touristic reasons and landmark for I don't know navigational reasons or something .
Grad A : Yep .
Grad B : Right .
Grad C : Yeah , we meant , uh , touristic reasons .
Grad B : Yeah .
Grad D : OK .
Grad A : Hmm .
Grad B : Right .
Grad D : OK . but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth both kinds of things there for different um , goals .
Grad A : Hmm .
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad B : Right .
Grad D : Right ?
Grad B : But {disfmarker} Yeah . Tourist - y landmarks also happen to be {disfmarker} Wouldn't {disfmarker} couldn't they also be {disfmarker} They 're not exclusive groups , are they ? Like {pause} non - tourist - y landmarks and
Grad A : Or it can be als
Grad B : direct navigational {disfmarker}
Grad D : They 're not mutually exclusive ?
Grad B : Yeah .
Grad D : Right .
Grad B : OK .
Grad D : Right . Definitely .
Grad B : OK , So our initial idea was not very satisfying , {pause} because {disfmarker} uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node . Uh .
Grad D : So , a big flat structure .
Grad B : Right .
Grad D : Right ?
Grad C : Yep .
Grad B : And uh , so we {disfmarker} Reasons being , you know , it 'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that . If we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort , uh according Bhaskara we 'd be handicapped . I don't know belief - nets very well .
Grad C : Well usually , I mean , you know , N {disfmarker} If you have N features , then it 's two to the N {disfmarker} {pause} or exponential in N .
Grad B : And they wouldn't look pretty . So .
Grad C : Yeah , they 'd all be like pointing to the one node .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : Uh . So then our next idea was to add a middle layer , right ? So the thinking behind that was {vocalsound} we have the features that we 've drawn {pause} from the communication of some {disfmarker} Like , the someone s The person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea , like "" I 'm {disfmarker} "" the {disfmarker} the abstract idea being "" I am a tourist I want to go {pause} to this place . "" Right ? So we 're gonna set up features along the lines of where they want to go and {pause} what they 've said previously and whatnot . And then we have {pause} the means {vocalsound} that they should use . Right ? but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a tourist {pause} or {pause} whether they 're running an errand or something like that along those lines . Or {disfmarker} Yes , we could things we couldn't extract the {disfmarker} from the data , the hidden variables . Yes , good . So then the hidden variables {disfmarker} hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry , because we were thinking uh , if they were in a hurry there 'd be less likely to {disfmarker} like {disfmarker} or th
Grad C : Want to do Vista ,
Grad B : Right .
Grad C : right ? Because {pause} if you want to view things you wouldn't be in a hurry .
Grad B : Or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a {disfmarker} like a {pause} navigational point to go to another place .
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : Whether the destination was their final destination , whether the destination was closed . Those are all {disfmarker} And then "" Let 's look at the belief - net "" {comment} OK . So that means that I should switch to the {pause} other program . Um right now it 's still kind of {pause} in a toy {pause} version of it , because we didn't know the probabilities of {disfmarker} {pause} or {disfmarker} Well I 'll talk about it when I get the picture up .
Grad A : No one knows it .
Grad B : OK . So this right {disfmarker} what we {disfmarker} Let 's see . What happens if I maximize this ? There we go . But uh {disfmarker} So . The mode {pause} basically has three different {pause} outputs . The probability {disfmarker} whether the probability of a Vista , Tango , or Enter . Um {disfmarker} The "" context "" , we simplified . Basically it 's just the businessman , the tourist , unknown . "" Verb used "" is actually personally amusing mainly because it 's {disfmarker} it 's just whether the verb is a Tango verb , an Enter verb , or a {pause} Vista verb .
Grad C : Yeah , that one needs a lot of {disfmarker}
Grad D : And are those mutually exclusive sets ?
Grad B : No .
Grad C : Not at all . That 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that needs a lot of work .
Grad D : Right .
Grad C : But uh {vocalsound} {pause} that would 've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter ,
Grad D : Got it . Uh - huh .
Grad C : so we decided that for the purposes of this {pause} it 'd be simpler to just have three verbs .
Grad D : Yeah . Simple .
Grad B : Yeah .
Grad D : Stab at it . Yep .
Grad B : Right . Um {disfmarker} Why don't you mention things about this , Bhaskara , that I am {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} that are not coming to my mind right now .
Grad C : OK , so {disfmarker} Yeah , so note the four nodes down there , the {disfmarker} sort of , the things that are not directly extracted . Actually , the five things . The "" closed "" is also not directly extracted I guess , from the uh {disfmarker}
Grad B : Well i it 's {disfmarker}
Grad C : Hmm .
Grad D : From the {pause} utterance ?
Grad B : it 's so it sort of is
Grad C : Actually , no , wait .
Grad B : because it 's {disfmarker} because have the {disfmarker} the time of day
Grad C : It is . OK , "" closed "" sort of is .
Grad B : and the close it just had the {disfmarker} er and what time it closed .
Grad C : Right , so f Right , but the other ones , the final destination , the whether they 're doing business , whether they 're in a hurry , and whether they 're tourists , that kind of thing is all uh {vocalsound} sort of {disfmarker} you know probabilistically depends on the other things .
Grad D : Inferred from the other ones ?
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad D : OK .
Grad C : And the mode , you know , depends on all those things only .
Grad B : Yeah the {disfmarker} {pause} the actual parse is somewhere up around in here .
Grad C : Yeah . So we haven't uh , managed {disfmarker} Like we don't have nodes for "" discourse "" and "" parse "" , although like in some sense they are parts of this belief - net .
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : But uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The idea is that we just extract those features from them , so we don't actually have a node for the entire parse ,
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : Right .
Grad C : because we 'd never do inference on it anyway , so .
Grad D : So some of the {disfmarker} the top row of things {disfmarker} What 's {disfmarker} what 's "" Disc admission fee "" ?
Grad C : whether they discuss the admission fees . So we looked at the data and in a lot of data people were saying things like {vocalsound} "" Can I get to this place ? ""
Grad D : Oh .
Grad C : "" What is the admission fee ? "" . So that 's like a huge uh clue that they 're trying to Enter the place rather than uh to Tango or Vista ,
Grad D : Uh - huh .
Grad B : Right .
Grad D : OK .
Grad C : so .
Grad D : I see .
Grad B : There were {disfmarker} there 'd be other things besides just the admission fee , but {pause} you know , {pause} we didn't have {disfmarker}
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : That was like our example .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : That was the {pause} initial one that we found .
Grad D : OK . So there are certain cues that are very strong {pause} either lexical or topic - based um , concept cues
Grad B : From the discourse that {disfmarker} Yeah .
Grad D : for one of those . And then in that second row {pause} or whatever that row of Time of Day through that {disfmarker} So all of those {disfmarker} Some of them come from the utterance and some of them are sort of {vocalsound} either world knowledge or situational {pause} things .
Grad B : Right .
Grad D : Right ? So that you have no distinction between those and OK .
Grad B : One , uh {disfmarker} Uh . {vocalsound} Um , anything else you want to say Bhaskara ?
Grad C : Um .
Grad D : "" Unmark @ @ Time of Day ""
Grad C : Yeah , I m I mean {disfmarker}
Grad A : Yeah . They 're {disfmarker} they 're are a couple of more things .
Grad B : One thing {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker}
Grad A : I mean Uh . I would actually suggest we go through this one more time so we {disfmarker} we all uh , agree on what {disfmarker} what the meaning of these things is at the moment and maybe {vocalsound} what changes we {disfmarker}
Grad B : Yeah , th OK . so one thing I {disfmarker} I 'm you know unsure about , is how we have the discus uh {disfmarker} the "" admission fee "" thing set up . So one {pause} thing that we were thinking was {vocalsound} by doing the layers like this , Uh {disfmarker} we kept um {disfmarker} things from directly affecting the mode {pause} beyond the concept , but you could see perhaps discus the "" admission fee "" going directly to the mode pointing at "" Enter "" ,
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : right ? Versus pointing to just at "" tourist "" ,
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : OK ?
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : But we just decided to keep all the things we extracted {pause} to point at the middle and then {pause} down .
Grad A : Mm - hmm . Why is the landmark {disfmarker} OK . The landmark is facing to the tourists . That 's because we 're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks not as possible um
Grad B : Right .
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad B : Navigational landmarks ,
Grad D : Navigational cue .
Grad A : navigational landmarks
Grad B : yeah .
Grad A : so Mm - hmm . Then {disfmarker}
Grad B : Yeah , that would be {pause} whatever building they referred to .
Grad D : Prosody .
Grad C : Right . So let 's see . The variables .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : Disc - "" admission fee "" is a binary thing , "" time of day "" is like morning , afternoon , night . Is that the deal ? Yeah .
Grad B : That 's how we have it currently set up ,
Grad A : Yep .
Grad B : but it could be , {pause} you know , based upon hour
Grad C : Yeah . Yeah .
Grad A : Whatever granularity .
Grad B : or {pause} dis we could discrete it {disfmarker} des descret - ize it .
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad A : Uh - huh .
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : Yeah . Normally context will include a huge amount of information , but um , we are just using the particular {vocalsound} part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're a tourist or not , I guess .
Grad A : Yep .
Grad D : OK . So that 's given in their input .
Grad B : Right .
Grad C : So {disfmarker} Right ,
Grad D : Right ?
Grad C : so it 's not really all of context . Similarly prosody is not all of prosody but simply {vocalsound} for our purposes whether or not they appear tense or relaxed .
Grad A : Mm - hmm . that 's very nice , huh ?
Grad D : OK .
Grad A : The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} So the context is a switch between tourist or non - tourist ?
Grad C : and
Grad A : Or also unknown ?
Grad B : Or un {pause} unknown ,
Grad A : OK .
Grad B : yeah .
Grad C : Yeah . Unknown , right ?
Grad D : So final dest So it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist ,
Grad C : Which is th Which one ?
Grad D : but OK . so the the context being um , e I don't know if that question 's sort of in general , "" are you {disfmarker} "" I mean the {disfmarker} ar ar are do they allow business people to be doing non - business things at the moment ?
Grad C : Yeah , it does .
Grad D : OK . So then you just have some probabilities over {disfmarker}
Grad C : Everything is probablistic , and {disfmarker} There 's always {disfmarker}
Grad D : OK . {disfmarker} over which which of those it is .
Grad C : Yeah . Um , right . So then landmark is {disfmarker} Oh , sorry . "" Verb used "" is like , right now we only have three values , but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs .
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : Rather , let me rephrase that . It {disfmarker} it can take values {vocalsound} in the set of all verbs , that they could possibly use .
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : Um "" nice walls "" is binary , "" closed "" is binary "" final destination "" , again {disfmarker} Yeah , all those are binary I guess . And "" mode "" is one of three things .
Grad A : So , the {disfmarker} the middle layer is also binary ? No .
Grad C : Yeah , anything with a question mark after it in that picture is a binary node .
Grad A : Uh . It {disfmarker} Yeah . But all those things without question marks are also binary . Right ?
Grad C : Which things ?
Grad A : Nice walls ?
Grad B : Wi
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : Oh . "" Nice walls "" is uh {disfmarker} something that we extract from our world knowledge .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : Yeah , a Oh yeah . Sorry . It is binary .
Grad B : It is binary but it doesn't have question mark because it 's extracted .
Grad C : That 's true . Yeah . OK , I see your point .
Grad A : Yeah . OK .
Grad B : Yeah .
Grad A : I {disfmarker} I gotcha .
Grad D : Uh - huh .
Grad C : Yeah , similarly "" closed "" , I guess .
Grad A : So we can either be in a hurry or not , but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment ?
Grad C : Well , we To do that we would add another uh {disfmarker} value for that .
Grad A : Mm - hmm . OK .
Grad C : And that would require s updating the probability distribution for "" mode "" as well .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : Because it would now have to like uh {disfmarker} take that possibility into account .
Grad D : Mm - hmm . Take a conti
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad D : So um , of course this will happen when we think more about the kinds of verbs that are used in each cases
Grad A : Yeah , yeah .
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad D : but you can imagine that it 's verb plus various other things that are also not in the bottom layer that would {disfmarker} that would help you {disfmarker} Like it 's a conjunction of , I don't know , you know , the verb used and some other stuff that {disfmarker} that would {vocalsound} {pause} determine {disfmarker}
Grad C : Right . Other syntactic information you mean ?
Grad D : Yeah . Exactly .
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad D : Um .
Grad A : well the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} sort of the landmark is {disfmarker} is sort of the object right ? the argument in a sense ?
Grad D : Usually . I {disfmarker} I don't know if that 's always the case I {disfmarker} I guess haven't looked at the data as much as you guys have . So . Um .
Grad A : that 's always warping on something {disfmarker} some entity ,
Grad D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Grad A : and um {disfmarker} Uh maybe at this stage we will {disfmarker} we do want to {disfmarker} uh sort of get {disfmarker} uh modifiers in there
Grad B : Hmm . Yeah .
Grad A : because they may also tell us whether the person is in a hurry or not
Grad B : I want to get to the church quickly ,
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : and uh {disfmarker}
Grad C : Yeah , right .
Grad D : That would be a cue .
Grad A : what 's the fastest way
Grad C : Yeah , correct .
Grad D : Mm - hmm . Um . OK .
Grad B : Right . Excellent . Do we have anything else to say about this ?
Grad C : We can do a little demo .
Grad B : Oh the Yeah , we could . But the demo doesn't work very well .
Grad A : No , then it wouldn't be a demo I was just gonna s
Grad C : I mean {disfmarker} We can do a demo in the sense that we can um , {vocalsound} just ob observe the fact that this will , in fact do inference .
Grad B : Observe nodes .
Grad C : So we can , you know , set some of the uh nodes and then try to find the probability of other nodes .
Grad D : Yeah . Go ahead .
Grad B : OK . Dat - dat - dah . What should I observe ?
Grad C : Just se set a few of them . You don't have to do the whole thing that we did last time . Just like uh , {vocalsound} maybe the fact that they use a certain verb {disfmarker}
Grad B : OK .
Grad C : Actually forget the verb .
Grad B : OK .
Grad C : just uh {disfmarker} I don't know , say they discussed the admission fee {disfmarker}
Grad B : OK .
Grad C : and uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the place has nice walls
Grad B : I love nice walls , OK ? I 'm a big fan .
Grad C : and it 's night .
Grad D : it 's starting to grow on me
Grad B : And the time of day is night ?
Grad C : Yeah , no wait . That {disfmarker} that doesn't uh {disfmarker} it 's not really consistent . They don't discuss the admission fee . Make that false .
Grad B : Alright .
Grad C : And it 's night .
Grad B : Oh , they {disfmarker} OK . Oh whoops . I forgot to uh {disfmarker}
Grad C : That didn't work .
Grad B : Ach !
Grad D : I 'd like to do that again .
Grad B : One thing that bugs me about JavaBayes is you have to click that and do this .
Grad D : Yeah . That seems kind of redundant but .
Grad C : OK .
Grad B : That all you want ?
Grad C : Yes .
Grad B : OK . So let 's see . I want {pause} to query ,
Grad C : "" Go "" and , right , "" query "" .
Grad B : right ? the mode . OK , and then on here {disfmarker} So let 's see .
Grad C : So that {pause} is the probability that they 're Entering , Vista - ing or Tango - ing .
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : Yeah .
Grad C : And uh {disfmarker}
Grad D : So slightly {pause} biased {pause} toward "" Tango "" ing
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad B : If it 's night time , {pause} they have not discussed admission fee , and the n walls are nice .
Grad D : OK .
Grad B : So , yeah . I guess that {pause} sort of makes sense . The reason I say the {pause} demo doesn't work very well is yesterday we uh {disfmarker} {pause} observed everything in favor of {pause} taking a tour , and it came up as "" Tango "" , right ? Over and over again . We couldn't {disfmarker} we couldn't figure out how to turn it off of "" Tango "" .
Grad D : So . Uh - huh .
Grad C : It loves the Tango .
Grad D : Huh ! Um .
Grad C : Well , that 's obviously just to do with our probabilities .
Grad B : Yeah , yeah .
Grad C : Like , {pause} we totally hand - tuned the probabilities ,
Grad D : Yeah .
Grad C : right . We were like {vocalsound} "" hmm , well if the person does this and this and this , let 's say forty percent for this ,
Grad D : OK .
Grad C : fifty per "" Like , you know . So obviously that 's gonna happen .
Grad B : Yeah .
Grad D : Right .
Grad A : Yeah but it {disfmarker} it
Grad D : Maybe the bias toward "" Tango "" ing was yours , then ?
Grad B : Yeah ,
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad B : that 's {disfmarker} that 's at {disfmarker}
Grad C : It 's {disfmarker} So we have to like fit the probabilities .
Grad B : Spent my youth practicing the tango de la muerte .
Grad D : So , the real case ?
Grad A : However you know , it {disfmarker} The purpose was not really , at this stage , to come up with meaningful probabilities but to get thinking about that hidden middle layer . And so th
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad A : And {disfmarker}
Grad B : We would actually {disfmarker} I guess once we look at the data more we 'll get more hidden {pause} nodes ,
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad B : but I 'd like to see more . Not because it would {pause} expedite the probabilities , cuz it wouldn't . It would actually slow that down tremendously .
Grad C : Um . Well , yeah , I guess .
Grad B : But .
Grad C : Not that much though . Only a little early .
Grad B : No , I think we should have uh {disfmarker} exponentially more {pause} middle nodes than features we 've extracted . I 'm ju I 'm just jo
Grad C : OK .
Grad D : So . Are "" doing business "" versus "" tourist "" {disfmarker} They refer to your current task . Like {disfmarker} like current thing you want to do at this moment .
Grad C : Um . Yeah , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That 's {disfmarker} that 's an interesting point . Whether you 're {disfmarker} It 's whether {disfmarker} It 's not {disfmarker}
Grad D : And are th
Grad C : I think it 's more like "" Are you are tourist ? are you in Ham - like Heidelberg for a {disfmarker} ""
Grad D : Oh , so , I thought that was directly given by the context {pause} switch .
Grad C : That 's a different thing . What if the context , which is not set , but still they say things like , "" I want to go {pause} uh , see the uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the castle and uh , et cetera . ""
Grad A : Is it {disfmarker}
Grad B : Well the I kind of {pause} thought of "" doing business "" as more of running an errand type thing .
Grad C : Yeah . Business on the other hand is , uh , definitely what you 're doing .
Grad A : So if you run out of cash as a tourist , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and you need to go to the AT
Grad B : So {pause} i wi th
Grad D : OK . Oh , I see , you may have a task . wh you have to go get money and so you are doing business at that stage .
Grad A : Mmm .
Grad B : Right .
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad A : "" How do I get to the bank ? ""
Grad D : I see . Hmm .
Grad C : And that 'll affect whether you want to enter or you if you {disfmarker} kinda thing .
Grad D : OK . So the "" tourists "" node {pause} should be {pause} um , very consistent with the context node . Right ? If you say that 's more their {disfmarker} in general what their background is .
Grad C : Yeah , I think this context node is a bit of a {disfmarker} I don't know , like in d Uh {disfmarker} Do we {pause} wanna have {disfmarker} Like it 's {disfmarker}
Grad D : Are you assuming that or not ? Like is that to be {disfmarker} I mean if that 's accurate then that would determine tourist node .
Grad C : If the context were to set one way or another , that like strongly uh um , says something about whether {disfmarker} whether or not they 're tourists .
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : So what 's interesting is when it 's not {disfmarker} when it 's set to "" unknown "" .
Grad D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Grad A : We - what set the {disfmarker} they set the context to "" unknown "" ?
Grad D : OK .
Grad B : OK .
Grad C : Right now we haven't observed it , so I guess it 's sort of averaging over all those three possibilities .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : Right .
Grad C : But yes , you can set it to un "" unknown "" .
Grad A : And if we now do {disfmarker} leave everything else as is the results should be the same ,
Grad B : Oops .
Grad A : right ?
Grad B : No .
Grad C : Well no , because we {disfmarker} Th - the way we set the probabilities {vocalsound} might not have {disfmarker} Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's an {disfmarker} it 's an issue , right ? Like {disfmarker}
Grad A : Pretty much the same ?
Grad C : Yeah , it is . So the issue is that um in belief - nets , it 's not common to do what we did of like having , you know , a d bunch of values and then "" unknown "" as an actual value . What 's common is you just like don't observe the variable ,
Grad D : Yeah .
Grad A : Yep .
Grad C : right , and then just marginalizes {disfmarker}
Grad D : Yeah .
Grad C : But uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We didn't do this because we felt that there 'd {disfmarker} I guess we were thinking in terms of a switch that actually {disfmarker}
Grad B : We were thi Yeah ,
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad B : We were th
Grad C : But uh {disfmarker} I don't know y what the right thing is to do for that . I 'm not {disfmarker} I don't know if I totally am happy with {vocalsound} the way it is .
Grad A : Why don't we {disfmarker} Can we , um {disfmarker} How long would it take to {disfmarker} to add another {pause} node on the observatory and , um , play around with it ?
Grad C : Another node on what ?
Grad B : Uh , well it depends on how many things it 's linked to .
Grad A : Let 's just say make it really simple . If we create {pause} something that for example would be um {disfmarker} So th some things can be landmarks in your sense but {pause} they {pause} can never be entered ? So for example s a statue .
Grad C : Good point .
Grad A : Yeah ?
Grad B : Right .
Grad D : Mm - hmm .
Grad A : So {pause} maybe we wanna have "" landmark "" {pause} meaning now "" enterable landmark "" versus , um something that 's simply just a vista point , for example .
Grad B : Yeah , that 's true .
Grad A : Yeah ? uh , a statue or um {disfmarker}
Grad C : So basically it 's addressing a variable that 's "" enterable or not "" . So like an "" enterable , question mark "" .
Grad B : Also {disfmarker} {pause} you know , didn't we have a {pause} size as one ? The size of the landmark .
Grad C : What ?
Grad B : Cuz if it 's {disfmarker}
Grad C : Um . Not when we were doing this ,
Grad B : Yeah .
Grad C : but I guess at some point we did .
Grad B : For some reason I had that {disfmarker} OK , that was a thought that I had at one point but then went away .
Grad C : So you want to have a {disfmarker} a node for like whether or not it can be entered ?
Grad A : Well , for example , if we include that , yeah ?
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad A : um , accessibility or something , yeah ? "" Is it {disfmarker} Can it be entered ? ""
Grad C : Hmm .
Grad A : then of course , this is {pause} sort of binary as well .
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad A : And then um , there 's also the question whether it may be entered . In the sense that , you know , if it 's {pause} Tom {disfmarker} the house of Tom Cruise , you know , it 's enterable but you may not enter it . You know ? You 're not allowed to .
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad A : Unless you are , whatever , his {disfmarker} his divorce lawyer or something .
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad A : Yeah ? and um {disfmarker} And these are very observable sort of from the {disfmarker} from the ontology sort of things .
Grad B : Way Does it actually help to distinguish between those two cases though ? Whether it 's practically speaking enterable , or actually physically enterable {pause} or not ?
Grad A : y y If {disfmarker} If you 're running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter places that are usually not {vocalsound} al w you 're not usually {disfmarker} not allowed to uh m
Grad D : It seems like it would for uh , uh {pause} determining whether they wanna go into it or not .
Grad B : Well I can see why {disfmarker}
Grad D : Cuz they {disfmarker}
Grad A : Let 's get this uh b clearer . S so it 's matrix between if it 's not ";yes;4;yes;3;yes;5;yes;3;yes;4;yes;3;yes;2
"Grad A : Alright , so I 'm - I should read all of these numbers ?
Professor B : OK .
Grad E : Piece of paper ? I could borrow ?
Grad A : Oh yeah .
Professor B : OK , so uh i um I don't know whether Ami 's coming or not um but I think we oughta just get started .
Grad E : Nancy is uh currently in Berkeley but not here ?
Grad C : Nancy 's still stick ?
Professor B : Don't know . Anyway
Grad E : OK .
Professor B : Oh , so there you go . Anyway , so my idea f for today and we can uh decide that that isn't the right thing to do was to at {disfmarker} spend at least part of the time trying to eh build the influence links , you know which sets of things are uh relevant to which decisions and actually I had uh specific s suggestion to start first with the path ones . The database ones being in some sense less interesting to us although probably have to be done and so to do that so there 's {disfmarker} and the idea was we were gonna do two things
Grad C : Is your mike on ?
Professor B : Ah . Oh right , well . Yeah . We were gonna do two things one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what
Grad D : That 's funny .
Professor B : and then as a uh separate but related task uh particularly Bhaskara and I were going to try to decide what kinds of belief nodes are needed in order to um do what we {disfmarker} what we need to do . Once so but du we should sort of have all of the uh basic design of what influences what done before we decide exactly how to compute it . So I didn't {disfmarker} did you get a chance to look at all {disfmarker} yet ?
Grad D : Yeah , I looked at some of that stuff .
Professor B : Great . OK so let 's start with the uh belief - nets , the general influence stuff and then we 'll {disfmarker} then we 'll also at some point break and talk about the techy stuff .
Grad E : Well I think one could go there 's I think we can di discuss everything . First of all this I added , I knew from sort of basically this has to be there right ? Um
Professor B : Oh are you gonna go there or not ? Yeah , so one i
Grad E : Given {disfmarker} given uh uh not transverse the castle , the decision is does the person want to go there or is it just
Professor B : Right , true . Does have to be there . And I 'm sure we 'll find more as we go that
Grad E : And Hmm ? So Go - there in the first place or not is definitely uh one of the basic ones . We can start with that . Interesting effect . Um Is this basically true or false or maybe we 'll get
Professor B : Well {disfmarker}
Grad D : Which one ?
Grad E : what ?
Grad A : "" Go there "" .
Grad E : m right .
Professor B : so there is this question about
Grad E : Here we we actually get just probabilities ,
Professor B : Yeah .
Grad E : right for each down here .
Professor B : When we 're {disfmarker} yeah when we 're done . So {disfmarker} so
Grad E : Hmm .
Professor B : the {disfmarker} the reason it might not be true or false is that we did have this idea of when so it 's , you know uh current @ @ and so forth and so on or not at all ,
Grad E : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : right ? And so that a decision would be do we want that so you could {disfmarker} two different things you could do , you could have all those values for Go - there or you could have Go - there be binary and given that you 're going there when .
Grad E : When . How .
Professor B : Yeah and so forth .
Grad E : Why ,
Professor B : So I 'll let
Grad E : yeah .
Professor B : we 'll see .
Grad E : Hmm ?
Grad A : I mean it seems that you could um uh it seems that those things would be logically independent like you would wanna have them separate or binary , Go - there and then the {disfmarker} the possibilities of how to go there because {disfmarker}
Professor B : OK , that 's {disfmarker} let 's start that way .
Grad A : because , you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance but it 's much more complex to query when would be the most appropriate time .
Grad E : Hmm . Hmm . OK . And so I 've tried to come up with some initial things one could observe so who is the user ? Everything that has user comes from the user model everything that has situation comes from the situation model - A . We should be be clear . But when it comes to sort of writing down when you {disfmarker} when you do these things is it here ? You sort of have to a write the values this can take .
Professor B : Right .
Grad E : And here I was really uh in some s sometimes I was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid because um {disfmarker} this case it 's pretty simple , but as we will see the other ones um for example if it 's a running budget so what are the discrete values of a running budget ? So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished .
Grad A : Hmm .
Professor B : No uh
Grad E : How can I write here that this is something , a number that cr keeps on changing ? But OK . Thus is understandable ?
Grad A : Think so .
Grad C : Yes .
Grad E : So here for example .
Professor B : You 've s have you seen this before at all Keith , these belief - net things ?
Grad A : Uh , no , but I think I 'm following it . So far .
Grad E : So here is the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} we had that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions .
Professor B : Yeah .
Grad D : Hmm .
Grad E : There we wanted to keep sort of a running total of things .
Grad D : Is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend ? OK , h well I mean how is it different from user finance ?
Grad E : Um the finance is sort of here thought of as {disfmarker} as the financial policy a person carries out in his life , he {disfmarker} is he cheap , average , or spendy ?
Grad D : Alright .
Grad E : And um I didn't come uh maybe a user I don't know , I didn't want to write greediness , but
Grad A : Yeah . Hmm .
Professor B : Or cheapness .
Grad E : Welcome .
Grad A : User thrift .
Grad E : Welcome .
Professor B : Thrift , that 's good .
Grad D : Yeah .
Professor B : Great .
Grad E : There it is .
Professor B : Yeah . So Keith w what 's behind this is actually a program that will once you fill all this in actually s solve your belief - nets for you and stuff .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : So this is not just a display , this is actually a GUI to a simulator that will if we tell it all the right things we 'll wind up with a functioning belief - net at the other end .
Grad A : OK . OK .
Grad E : And it 's so simple even I can use it .
Grad A : Wow , that is simple .
Grad E : OK , so here was OK , I can think of uh people being cheap , average , or spendy or we can even have a {disfmarker} a finer scale moderately cheap ,
Professor B : Doesn't matter .
Grad E : doesn't matter . Agree there but here um I wasn't sure what to write in .
Professor B : Let 's {disfmarker} go ahead .
Grad D : Well , I mean you 've written in {disfmarker} you 've written in what uh seems to be required like what else is {disfmarker} is do you want ?
Grad E : If that 's permissible then I 'm happy .
Professor B : Well yeah . So here 's {disfmarker} here 's what 's permissible is that you can arrange so that the um the value of that is gonna have to be updated and n it 's not a belief update , right ? It 's {disfmarker} you took some actions , you spent money and stuff , so the update of that is gonna have to be essentially external to the belief - net . Right ?
Grad E : Yeah .
Professor B : And then what you 're going to need is uh for the things that it influences . Well let 's {disfmarker} first of all let 's see if it does influence anything . And if it does influence anything then you 're gonna need something that converts from the {disfmarker} the number here to something that 's relevant to the decision there . So it could be ra they create different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or whatever {disfmarker} but for the moment this is just a node that is conditioned externally and might influence various things .
Grad E : Hmm . Yeah {disfmarker} this is where um OK anyways let 's forget it .
Professor B : Well that 's fine . Well anyway , go ahead .
Grad E : OK , and so this , oh that
Grad D : The other thing is that um every time that 's updated beliefs will have to be propagated but then the question is do you {disfmarker} do we wanna propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ?
Professor B : Yeah , that 's a good question . And uh does it have a lazy mode ? I don't remember .
Grad D : Uh Well , I mean , in Srini 's thing there was this thing {disfmarker} there was this um option like proper inferences which suggests that uh doesn't happen , automatically .
Professor B : Oh right . Yeah . S probably does . Yeah someone has to track that down , but I {disfmarker} but uh And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and I think {disfmarker} actually uh
Grad E : I just accidentally Oops .
Professor B : one of the we w items for the uh user home base uh should be uh essentially non - local . I they 're only there for the day and they don't have a place that they 're staying .
Grad D : Well
Grad E : Oh just uh accidentally erased this , I {disfmarker} I just had values here such as uh um is he s we had in our list we had "" Is he staying in our hotel ? "" , "" Is he staying with friends ? "" , and so forth
Professor B : Yeah .
Grad E : uh so we 're OK .
Professor B : So it 's clear where w w w where we are right now . So my suggestion is we just pick uh
Grad E : Something down here ?
Professor B : one , you know one uh particular one of the uh well let 's do the first {disfmarker} first one let 's do the one that we sort of already think we did so w that was the {disfmarker} of the endpoint ?
Grad E : Mm - hmm . And um Oops .
Grad D : Is hmm
Grad E : Ah ,
Grad D : So it 's true or false ?
Professor B : No , that 's {disfmarker} that 's a
Grad E : OK . No no no , EVA .
Grad D : So
Grad E : Missed that one .
Grad C : What 's the difference between mode and endpoint ?
Grad D : I thought mode , yeah .
Professor B : although that
Grad E : Um mode was um
Professor B : Well , that 's
Grad D : Mode of transportation ?
Grad E : Yeah .
Grad D : OK . Also true or false .
Grad E : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : No , he has he hasn't filled them in yet , is what 's true .
Grad D : Yeah , OK .
Grad E : Did I or didn't I ?  Ah . Probably nothing done yet , oh I just did it on the upper ones , OK . Makes sense . OK , so this was EVA . Maybe we can think of more things , cross
Grad D : Yeah .
Grad A : Climb , rob .
Professor B : OK .
Grad E : climb , emerge
Professor B : No no no , these are ju that 's just a point ,
Grad C : Uh
Grad D : Well some of those are subsumed by approach .
Professor B : this is ju
Grad C : Would it be an endpoint if you were crossing over it ?
Grad A : The Charles Bridge , you know .
Professor B : Yeah , would be a f for a given segment . You know , you {disfmarker} y you go {disfmarker} first go the town square
Grad C : Well I eh
Grad A : No , I mean , if you go to re you know if you go to Prague or whatever one of your {disfmarker} your key points that you have to do is cross the Charles Bridge and doesn't really matter which way you cross which {disfmarker} where you end up at the end but the part {disfmarker} the good part is walking over it , so .
Professor B : That 's subtle , but true . Anyway so let 's just leave it three {disfmarker} with three for now
Grad E : Mm - hmm , mmm . Yeah .
Professor B : and let 's see if we can get it linked up just to get ourselves started .
Grad E : OK , we
Professor B : You 'll see it {disfmarker} you 'll see something comes up immediately , that the reason I wanna do this .
Grad E : w well the uh user was uh definitely more likely to enter if he 's a local
Professor B : Right . Right .
Grad E : more likely to view if he 's a tourist um and then of course we had the fact that given the fact that he 's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross um
Professor B : We did , but the three things w that {disfmarker} that it contributed to this in fact , the other two aren't up there . so one was the ontology
Grad E : We 'll d what type of building is it ?
Professor B : Yeah .
Grad E : Yeah .
Professor B : And the {disfmarker} and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse .
Grad E : What he has mentioned before .
Professor B : OK , so this is w Right , so what w I {disfmarker} what we seem to need here , this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff
Grad A : mm - hmm
Professor B : the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . So each of those the way we had it designed , now we can change the design , but the design we had was there was a decision with the same three outcomes uh based on the th those three separate considerations
Grad A : mm - hmm
Professor B : so if we wanted to do that would have to put in uh three intermediate nodes
Grad E : Uh we can load it up it you know very simple .
Grad A : So
Professor B : and then what you and I have to talk about is , OK if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow uh how do they get combined ? But the {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about .
Grad E : So this was adjusted for this one mode thing .
Grad D : Oh yes .
Professor B : Yeah .
Grad E : So that 's w w in our uh in {disfmarker} in Johno 's sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter , view , or approach something .
Professor B : Oh , it was called mode , so this {disfmarker} this is m mode here means the same as endpoint .
Grad E : Is now this endpoint .
Grad C : Right .
Professor B : OK , why don't we ch can we change that ?
Grad E : We can just rename that , yeah .
Professor B : Alright . You know , but that was actually , yeah unfortunately that was a um kind of an intermediate versio that 's I don't think what we would currently do .
Grad A : Can I ask about "" slurred "" and "" angry "" as inputs to this ?
Professor B : That 's a
Grad A : What {disfmarker} why ?
Grad D : Like they 're either true or false
Grad E : The prosody ?
Grad A : OK .
Grad D : and they uh oh I see .
Grad C : If the {disfmarker} if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech they might be tired or , you know
Grad A : Mm - hmm . OK . Drunk .
Grad D : Therefore
Grad C : And , you know , possibly uh
Grad A : Less likely to enter .
Grad C : some ,
Grad A : Hmm .
Grad C : yeah .
Grad D : uh I was thinking less likely to view
Professor B : Yeah . But that 's - that seems to , yeah . So {disfmarker} so my advice to do is {disfmarker} is get this down to what we think is actually likely to {disfmarker} to be a {disfmarker} a strong influence .
Grad A : OK .
Professor B : But yeah , that was what he had in mind .
Grad D : Right .
Professor B : So let 's think about this {disfmarker} this question of how do we wanna handle {disfmarker} so there 're two separate things . One is {disfmarker} uh at least two . One is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing Bhaskara , is uh can we arrange so that I think we can so that the belief - net itself has properties and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items . So the {disfmarker} let 's take the case of the uh this endpoint thing , the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark is it a place of business uh is it something you physically could enter
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : OK , et cetera . So that there 'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node and then again as part of the ou outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set , so that some somehow someone would find this word , look it up in the ontology , pull out these properties , put it into the belief - net , and then the decision would flow .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : Now
Grad E : Seems to me that we 've sort of e em embedded a lot , em embedded a lot of these uh things we had in there previously in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in some of the other final decisions done here , for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something um
Professor B : Right . Right .
Grad E : if it 's exhibiting itself it is a landmark ,
Professor B : Yeah .
Grad E : meaning more likely to be viewed
Professor B : Yep .
Grad E : if it is exhibiting pictures or sculptures and stuff like this , then it 's more likely to be entered .
Professor B : I uh that 's {disfmarker} I think that 's completely right and um I think that 's good , right ? So what {disfmarker} what that says is that we might be able to uh take and in particular so {disfmarker} so the ones we talked about were uh exhibiting and selling
Grad E : Accessibility .
Professor B : no , accessibility meant
Grad E : If it 's closed one probably won't enter . Or if it 's not accessible to a tourist ever the likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it ,
Professor B : OK .
Grad E : given that he knows it , of course .
Professor B : Alright . So let me suggest this . Uh w could you move those up about halfway . Uh The ones that you th And selling I guess .
Grad E : Yeah , all {disfmarker} all of these if it 's fixing things selling things , or servicing things
Professor B : Right . So here {disfmarker} here 's what it looks like to me . is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of {disfmarker} of uh selling , f fixing , or servicing . So that it uh that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important but for this kind of purpose uh one of these places is quite like the other . Does that seem right ? So we di
Grad C : Basic you 're basically just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision ?
Professor B : if we Yes .
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : So if {disfmarker} well it may be more than endpoint decisions , so the idea would be that you might wanna merge those three
Grad E : These three ?
Professor B : Yeah . Eh ser s uh selling , fixing , and servicing .
Grad E : Yeah .
Grad D : What ex um and so either those is true f or false ?
Professor B : Uh Uh well it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} i here 's where it gets a little tricky .
Grad D : So
Professor B : Uh from the belief - net point of view it is from another point of view of course it 's interest it 's {disfmarker} it 's important to know what it 's selling or servicing and so forth .
Grad A : Yeah .
Professor B : So for this decision it 's just uh true or false
Grad D : OK . Yeah .
Professor B : and in th this is a case where the or seems just what you want .
Grad D : OK .
Professor B : That {disfmarker} that if any of those things is true then it 's the kind of place that you uh
Grad E : Um more likely to enter .
Professor B : are more likely to enter .
Grad D : So you just wanna have them all pointing to a summary thing ?
Professor B : You could , yeah . Yeah , so let 's do that . No no , no eh to {disfmarker} to an inter no , an intermediate node .
Grad D : T
Grad E : Oh , OK .
Professor B : That 's the p part of the idea , is
Grad E : Um is {disfmarker} is that the object type node ?
Professor B : I d
Grad E : So are they the {disfmarker} is it the kind of object that sells , fixes , or services things ?
Professor B : Well , o open up object type and let 's see what its values are .
Grad E : Oh I just created it , it has none so far .
Professor B : Oh , well OK first of all it 's not objects , we called them entities , right ?
Grad E : Yeah . And then we have sort of the um
Professor B : Let 's say I put commercial .
Grad E : Yeah , I w I was just gonna commercial action inside where people p
Professor B : Well couldn't I do {disfmarker} let 's do commercial uh landmark and
Grad E : And where was the accessible , yeah .
Professor B : Well accessible I think is different cuz that 's tempor that {disfmarker} that varies temporally ,
Grad E : Yeah .
Professor B : whereas this is a
Grad E : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : What would a hotel fall under ?
Professor B : I would call that a service , but {disfmarker} but I don't know .
Grad C : Well I mean in terms of entity type ?
Professor B : Say w w well it 's co I would s a a again for this purpose I think it 's commercial . Someplace you want to go in to do some kind of business .
Grad C : OK .
Grad D : Um what does the underscore - T at the end of each of those things signify ?
Grad E : Um things . So places that service things sell things or fix things and pe places that e exhibit things .
Grad D : Uh - huh . OK . OK . That also points to entity type I guess .
Grad A : So we 're deriving um this {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} this feature of whether the {disfmarker} the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we 're deriving that from what kind of activity is done there ? Couldn't you have it as just a primitive feature of the entity ?
Professor B : Well you could , that 's a {disfmarker} that 's a choice .
Grad A : OK .
Professor B : So uh
Grad A : I mean it seems like that 's much more reliable cuz you could have outdoor places that sell things and you know indoor places that do something else
Professor B : Yeah , the problem with it is that it sort of putting in a feature just for one decision ,
Grad A : and Hmm .
Professor B : now w we may wind up having to do that this i anyway , this i
Grad A : OK .
Professor B : at a mental level that 's what we we 're gonna have to sort out .
Grad A : OK .
Professor B : So , you know what does this look like , what are {disfmarker} what are uh intermediate things that are worth computing , what are the features we need in order to make all these decisions
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : and what 's the best way to organize this so that um it 's clean and {disfmarker} and consistent and all that sort of stuff .
Grad A : OK . I 'm just thinking about how people , human beings who know about places and places to go and so on would store this and it would probably {disfmarker} you wouldn't just sort of remember that they sell stuff and then deduce from that that it must be going on inside or something .
Grad E : Well I think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things , it can either em do s do sell things , fix things , service things , exhibit things , it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things ,
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad E : it 's not either or mmm certainly a place can be a hotel and a famous site .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad E : Many come to mind . Things can be generally um a landmark and be accessible . IE a {disfmarker} a castle or can be a landmark a or not accessible , some statue
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad E : you know can go inside .
Professor B : OK . Anyway so let me suggest you do something else . Uh which is to get rid {disfmarker} get rid of that l long link between who {disfmarker} the user and the endpoint .
Grad E : Could we just move it like this ?
Professor B : No no , I don't want the link there at all .
Grad E : Oh , OK .
Professor B : Because what we 're gonna want is an intermediate thing which is uh the endpoint decisi the endpoint decision based o on the user models , so what we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} what we talked about is three separate endpoint decisions , so let 's make a new node
Grad E : Yeah . Yeah .
Grad C : Just as a suggestion maybe you could "" save as "" to keep your old one nice and clean and so you can mess with this one .
Grad E : Mmm . The old one was not that not that important , I think but
Grad C : OK , well , not a big deal then .
Grad E : Let 's do it then .
Grad C : Well the {disfmarker} Isn't there a "" save as "" inside of java base ?
Grad E : But I can just take this
Grad C : OK .
Grad E : copy it somewhere else . This was user something
Professor B : Well this was
Grad E : or
Professor B : uh let 's p put it this {disfmarker} let 's do endpoint underbar - U .
Grad E : end point ?
Professor B : i endpoint , e end poi this is sa
Grad E : Ah .
Professor B : it 's the endpoint
Grad E : Gotcha , yeah .
Professor B : let 's say underbar - U , so that 's the endpoint decision uh as seen through the
Grad C : As related from the user model .
Professor B : Right . So let 's {disfmarker} let 's actually yeah so lin you can link that up to the
Grad E : Should I rename this {pause} too ?
Professor B : uh yeah , so that , I guess that 's endpoint uh
Grad E :  It 's underscore - E .
Professor B : underscore - E for entity , and we may change all this , but . Right . And
Grad E : OK , shouldn't I be able to move them all ? No . Or {disfmarker} ? Can I ? Where ? What ?
Professor B : Oh I d eh I don't know . Actually , I guess the easiest thing would move {disfmarker} mo move the endpoint , well , go ahead . Just do whatever .
Grad E : Wasn't this possible ?
Professor B : Well .
Grad E : Yeah .
Grad C : I think you have to be in move mode before
Grad E : Uh - huh . OK .
Professor B : Good . Right .
Grad E : So now we 're looking for user related things that um
Professor B : Yeah . And uh maybe th maybe it 's just one who is the user , I don't know , maybe {disfmarker} maybe there 's more .
Grad A : Huh .
Grad E : Well if he 's usi if he 's in a car right now what was that people with Harry drove the car into the cafe
Professor B : Never mind . Uh anyway , this is crude . Now but the {disfmarker} now so {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} but then the question is uh so {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology , but then we had this third idea of input from the discourse .
Grad E : Well let 's {disfmarker} should we finish this ,
Professor B : Sure ,
Grad E : I mean but surely the user interests
Professor B : OK .
Grad C : The user thrift , the user budget .
Grad E : yeah , yeah
Professor B : Well , maybe , I again , I d well , OK , put em in but what we 're gonna wanna do is actually uh
Grad C : Well is {disfmarker}
Grad E : Here this was one of my problems we have the user interest is a {disfmarker} is a vector of five hundred values , so um That 's from the user model ,
Grad D : Oh you mean level of interest ?
Grad E : mm - hmm , no not levels of interest but things you can be interested in .
Grad A : Well {disfmarker}
Professor B : somebody else has built this user model .
Grad D : Oh I see ,
Grad E : Gothic churches versus Baroque townhouses versus
Grad D : right . So why is it oh it , so it 's like a vector of five hundred one 's or zero 's ?
Grad E : Yea - n is that
Grad D : Like for each thing are we {disfmarker} are you interested in it or not ?
Grad E : yeah uh I {disfmarker} I think
Grad D : I see .
Grad A : Hmm .
Professor B : OK . So uh you cou and so here let me give you two ways to handle that . Alright ? One is um you could ignore it . But the other thing you could do is have an {disfmarker} and this will give you the flavor of the {disfmarker} of what you could have a node that 's {disfmarker} that was a measure of the match between the object 's feature , you know , the match between the object the entity , I 'm sorry and the user .
Grad E : Mm - hmm . Uh .
Professor B : So you could have a k a "" fit "" node and again that would have to be computed by someone else
Grad E : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : but uh so that uh
Grad E : Just as a mental note uh
Professor B : Yeah , that 's all .
Grad E : Mm - hmm . And {disfmarker} and should we say that this interests eh affects the likelihood of {disfmarker} of entering ?
Professor B : Yeah . I mean , we could .
Grad E : Yeah . And also if it 's an expensive place to enter , this may also
Professor B : OK .
Grad D : Budget .
Grad A : User schedule . "" Do I have time to go in and climb all the way to the top of the Koelner Dome {comment} or do I just have to {disfmarker} "" "" time to take a picture of the outside ? ""
Grad E : Schedule ?
Professor B : Right .
Grad C : It seems like everything in a user model a affects {disfmarker}
Professor B : Well that 's what we don't wanna do , see that {disfmarker} se cuz then we get into huge combinatorics and stuff like that
Grad C : Yeah .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : an
Grad C : Cuz if the , I mean , and if the user is tired , the user state ,
Grad D : Well
Grad C : right , it would affect stuff , but I can't see why e anything w everything in the model wouldn't be
Professor B : Well , but
Grad D : Right .
Professor B : Well , that {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} we can't do that , so we we 're gonna have to
Grad C : Yeah .
Professor B : but this is a good discussion , we 're gonna have to somehow figure out uh some way to encapsulate that uh so if there 's some general notion of for example the uh relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or something like that is {disfmarker} is the uh compatibility with his current state , so that 's what you 'd have to do , you 'd have to get it down to something which uh was itself relatively compact , so it could be compatibility with his current state which would include his money and his time and {disfmarker} and his energy
Grad C : Yeah , just seems like it 'd push the problem back a level .
Grad D : Right .
Professor B : It does .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : Yeah , but
Grad D : No but , it 's more than that , like the {disfmarker} the more sort of you break it up like because if you have everything pointing to one node it 's like exponential whereas if you like keep breaking it up more and more it 's not exponential anymore .
Professor B : So it yeah , there are two advantages . That 's tha there 's one technical one
Grad C : Sh - sh yeah , {disfmarker}
Professor B : and the other is it {disfmarker} it gets used
Grad C : S so we 'd basically be doing subgrouping ? Subgrouping , basically into mo
Grad D : Yeah .
Grad C : so basically make it more tree like going backwards ?
Grad D : Right .
Grad A : Yeah .
Professor B : Right . But it {disfmarker} there 's two advantages , one is the technical one that you don't wind up with such big exponential uh CBT 's ,
Grad E : Bhaskara ?
Professor B : the other is it can be {disfmarker} it presumably can be used for multiple decisions .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : So that if you have this idea of the compatibility with the requirements of an action to the state of the user one could well imagine that that was u
Grad D : Right .
Professor B : not only is it sim is it cleaner to compute it separately but it could be that it 's used in multiple places . Anyway th so in general this is the design , this is really design problem .
Grad E : Yeah .
Professor B : OK , you 've got a signal , a d set of decisions um how do we do this ?
Grad E : What do I have under user state anyhow cuz I named that already something . Oh that 's tired , fresh , yeah . Maybe should be renamed into physical state .
Professor B : Or fat user fatigue even .
Grad A : Hmm .
Grad E : That 's with a "" G "" ?
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Professor B :  Whatever .
Grad E : Then we can make a user state .
Professor B : What 's th what we 're talking about is compatibility . Uh or something , I don't know , but .
Grad C : I guess the {disfmarker} the question uh is It 's hard for me to imagine how everything wouldn't just contribute to user state again . Or user compatibility .
Professor B : Oh but the thing is that we uh uh we had some things that uh
Grad E : That don't .
Professor B : that don't
Grad E : The user interests and the user who {disfmarker} who {disfmarker} who the user is are completely apart from the fact whether he is tired broke
Grad C : Sure , but other {disfmarker} I thought though the node we 're creating right now is user compatibility to the current action , right ?
Professor B : the right
Grad C : Seems like everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something .
Professor B : Uh maybe not . I mean the {disfmarker} that 's the {disfmarker} the issue is um would Even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of . And anyway we 're gonna have to find some way to cl uh get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible .
Grad E : Maybe um if we look at the {disfmarker} if we split it up again into sort of um if we look at the uh the endpoint again we {disfmarker} we said that for each of these things there are certain preconditions so you can only enter a place if you are n";yes;4;yes;4;yes;4;yes;3;yes;4;yes;2;yes;3
"Grad A : Ah , so comfortable .
Grad F : Smooth .
Grad A : Mm - hmm . Good . I know that he 's going to like , Taiwan and other places to eat . So .
Grad D : On ? Am I on ?
Grad A : Yep . Yep .
Grad D : I think I 'm on ?
Grad B : Yeah .
Grad D : Good . Good .
Grad A : Bye .
Grad B : Actually {disfmarker}
Grad F : I just had one of the most frustrating meetings of my career .
Grad A : It 's definitely not the most frustrating meeting I 've ever had .
Grad D : You a You 're {disfmarker} you remember you 're being recorded at this point .
Grad A : Oh , yeah , so , w we didn't yet specify with whom .
Professor E : Yeah .
Grad F : Yeah .
Professor E : Right .
Grad A : But um .
Professor E : Uh , right .
Grad A : So that 's why Keith and I are going to be a little dazed for the first half m the meeting .
Professor E : Uh .
Grad F : Huh . Yeah , I 'm just gonna sit here and
Professor E : Right . Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I avoided that as long as I could for you guys ,
Grad F : growl .
Professor E : but , uh {disfmarker}
Grad F : Yeah .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad F : For which we thank you , by the way .
Grad A : Are very appreciative , yeah .
Professor E : Right .
Grad F : I know you were {disfmarker} you were doing that , but , anyway .
Grad D : Oh yeah , how di how d exactly did , uh , that paper lead to anti - lock brakes ?
Grad F : Oh , I could tell you had a rough day , man !
Grad D : Nah .
Grad A : What ?
Grad D : I love that story .
Grad F : Yeah , it 's a great story .
Grad C : OK .
Grad F : Oh my goodness .
Grad C : Oh yeah , um , Liz suggested we could start off by uh , doing the digits all at the same time .
Grad A : What ?
Grad D : All at the same time . I don't know if {disfmarker} I would get distracted and confused , probably .
Professor E : e
Grad A : Really ? Do we have to like , synchronize ?
Professor E : Well , I think you 're supposed to {disfmarker} OK . We can do this .
Grad F : Are you being silly ?
Grad D : Oh wait do we have t
Professor E : Everybody 's got different digits ,
Grad C : Yep .
Professor E : right ?
Grad D : Yeah , do we have to time them at the same time or just overlapping {disfmarker}
Grad F : Uh .
Grad A : You 're kidding .
Grad C : No , no , just {disfmarker} just start whenever you want .
Professor E : No .
Grad A : And any rate ?
Professor E : e yeah , the
Grad F : Alright .
Professor E : Well , they {disfmarker} they have s they have the close talking microphones for each of us ,
Grad A : Yeah , that 's true .
Professor E : so {disfmarker}
Grad C : Yeah .
Professor E : yeah , there 's separate channels .
Grad F : Alright .
Grad A : OK .
Grad C : Yeah .
Professor E : So when I say
Grad F : Just plug one ear .
Grad A : You lose .
Professor E : OK .
Grad F : OK , bye ! That was a great meeting !
Professor E : Right .
Grad D : Alright .
Grad F : So - {vocalsound} Now , uh , why ?
Grad C : Just to save time .
Grad F : OK .
Grad C : Does matter for them .
Grad A : Are we gonna start all our meetings out that way from now on ?
Professor E : No .
Grad A : Oh . Too bad . I kinda like it .
Grad F : Well , could we ?
Grad D : It 's strangely satisfying .
Grad A : Yeah . It 's a ritual .
Grad D : Are we to r Just to make sure I know what 's going on , we 're talking about Robert 's thesis proposal today ? Is that
Grad C : We could .
Grad D : true ?
Grad A : We are ?
Grad C : We might .
Grad A : OK .
Grad D : Is {disfmarker}
Professor E : Well , you {disfmarker} you had s you said there were two things that you might wanna do . One was rehearse your i i talk {disfmarker}
Grad D : Oh yes , and that too .
Grad C : Not {disfmarker} not rehearse , I mean , I have just not spent any time on it , so I can show you what I 've got , get your input on it , and maybe some suggestions , that would be great . And the same is true for the proposal . I will have time to do some revision and some additional stuff on various airplanes and trains . So , um . I don't know how much of a chance you had to actually read it
Grad A : I haven't looked at it
Grad C : because {disfmarker}
Grad A : yet ,
Grad C : but you could always send me comments per electronic mail
Grad A : but I will .
Grad C : and they will be incorporated .
Grad A : OK .
Grad C : Um , {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} It basically says , well "" this is construal "" , and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general , domain - general rules how things are construed , and then the idea is to use ontology , situation , user , and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model {pause} to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what
Grad A : Hmm .
Grad C : in our beloved tourism domain . But , with a focus on
Grad A : Can I s Sorry .
Grad F : I think I need a copy of this , yes .
Grad C : Hmm ?
Grad D : OK , we can {disfmarker} we can {disfmarker} we can pass {disfmarker} pass my , uh {disfmarker} we can pass my extra copy around .
Grad F : I is there an extra copy around ?
Grad A : Uh . He sent it . OK . You can keep it .
Grad D : Er , actually , my only copy , now that I think about it ,
Grad F : Alrigh
Grad A : OK .
Grad C : Um , I don't {disfmarker} I , uh {disfmarker} I don't need it .
Grad D : but . I already read half of it , so it 's OK .
Grad C : Um , actually this is the {disfmarker} the newest version after your comments ,
Grad F : OK .
Grad C : and {disfmarker}
Professor E : Yeah , no I s I s I see this has got the castle in it , and stuff like that .
Grad C : Yeah .
Professor E : Yep .
Grad D : Oh , maybe the version I didn't have that I {disfmarker} mine {disfmarker} the w did the one you sent on the email have the {disfmarker}
Professor E : Yeah .
Grad D : That was the most recent one ?
Professor E : Uh , yeah , I think so .
Grad C : Yep .
Grad D : OK . Cuz I read halfway but I didn't see a castle thing .
Grad A : I 'm changing this . Just so you know .
Grad C : Yeah ,
Grad A : But , anyway .
Grad C : um , if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from Yees asking you to send me the , uh , up - to - d
Grad A : Oh . Oh , sorry . OK . Sorry .
Grad C : current formalism thing that you presented .
Grad A : OK . I will . OK . OK . OK .
Grad C : But for this it doesn't matter . But , uh {disfmarker}
Grad A : We can talk about it later . That 's not even ready , so . Um , OK ! Go on t to , uh , whatever .
Grad C : And {disfmarker}
Grad A : I 'm making changes . "" Don't worry about that . "" OK . Mmm - mmm . Oh ! OK , sorry , go on .
Grad C : And any type of comment whether it 's a spelling or a syntax or
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : readability {disfmarker}
Grad F : There 's only one "" S "" in "" interesting "" .
Grad C : Hmm ?
Grad F : There 's only one "" S "" in "" interesting "" . On page five .
Grad C : Interesting .
Grad A : Anyway . And y uh , email any time , but most usefully before {disfmarker}
Grad D : The twenty - first I 'm assuming .
Grad A : The twenty - first ?
Grad C : Twenty - ninth .
Professor E : No , this is the twenty - first .
Grad F : That 's {disfmarker}
Grad D : What , today 's the twenty - first ?
Grad F : Well , better hurry up then !
Grad D : Oh , man !
Grad A : Before the twenty - ninth ,
Grad C : The twenty - ninth .
Grad A : OK .
Grad D : OK .
Grad C : That 's when I 'm meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to sell him this idea .
Grad A : Mm - hmm . OK .
Grad C : OK ? Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML , about what we have done here and so of course , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm gonna start out with this slide , so the most relevant aspects of our stay here , and um , then I 'm asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in Heidelberg and someone asks them in the morning {disfmarker} The Cave Forty - Five is a {disfmarker} is a well - known discotheque which is certainly not open at that {disfmarker} that time . And so
Grad F : OK .
Grad C : they 're supposed to imagine that , you know , do they think the person wants to go there , or just know where it is ? Uh , which is probably not , uh , the case in that discotheque example , or in the Bavaria example , you just want to know where it is . And so forth . So basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it 's nine {disfmarker} nine PM in the evening then the discotheque question would be , for example , one that might ask for directions instead of just location . Um , {vocalsound} and so forth and so forth . That 's sort of motivating it . Then what have we done so far ? We had our little bit of , um , um , SmartKom stuff , that we did , um , everth
Grad F : Oh , you 've got the parser done . Sorry .
Grad C : That 's the {disfmarker} not the construction parser . That 's the , uh , tablet - based parser ,
Grad F : OK .
Grad A : Easy parser .
Grad F : OK .
Grad C : and the generation outputter .
Grad D : Halfway done ? Yeah .
Grad C : That 's done .
Grad A : Mmm .
Grad C : You have to change those strategies ,
Grad D : OK .
Grad C : right ? That 's , ten words ?
Grad D : Yeah . Well , i it , you know . Maybe twelve .
Grad C : Twelve ? OK . And , um , and Fey is doing the synthesis stuff as we speak . That 's all about that . Then I 'm going to talk about the data , you know these things about {disfmarker} uh , actually I have an example , probably . Two s Can you hear that ? Or should I turn the l volume on .
Grad F : Mm - hmm .
Grad A : I could hear it .
Grad D : I I can hear it .
Grad F : I heard it .
Grad D : They might not hear it in the {disfmarker} well maybe they will . I don't know .
Grad A : This was an actual , um , subject ? Ah .
Grad C : Mm - hmm .
Grad F : Sounds like Fey .
Grad A : Yeah .
Grad C : But they 're {disfmarker} they 're mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer ,
Grad F : Oh , OK .
Grad C : the {disfmarker} you can observe that all the time , they 're trying to match their prosody onto the machine .
Grad F : Oh really . Interesting . Oh , it 's pretty slow .
Grad C : Yeah , you have to {disfmarker}
Grad A : Wh
Grad F : The system breaking .
Grad A : What is the s ? Oh !
Grad C : OK . And so forth and so forth . Um , I will talk about our problems with the rephrasing , and how we solved it , and some preliminary observations , also , um , I 'm not gonna put in the figures from Liz , but I thought it would interesting to , uh , um , point out that it 's basically the same . Um , as in every human - human telephone conversation , and the human - computer telephone conversation is of course quite d quite different from , uh , some first , uh , observations . Then sort of feed you back to our original problem cuz , uh {disfmarker} how to get there , what actually is happening there today , and then maybe talk about the big picture here , e tell a little bit {disfmarker} as much as I {pause} can about the NTL story . I {disfmarker} I wa I do wanna , um {disfmarker} I 'm not quite sure about this , whether I should put this in , um , that , you know , you have these two sort of different ideas that are {disfmarker} or two different camps of people envisioning how language understanding works , and then , {vocalsound} talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here and as a prelude , I 'll talk about monkeys in Italy . And , um , Srini was gonna send me some slides but he didn't do it , so from {disfmarker} but I have the paper , I can make a resume of that , and then I stole an X - schema from one of your talks I think .
Grad A : Oh . I was like , "" where 'd you get that ? "" OK .
Grad F : Yeah , that looks familiar .
Grad A : "" Looks familiar . ""
Grad C : I think that 's Bergen , Chang , something , or the other .
Grad A : Uh .
Professor E : Whatever .
Grad A : OK .
Grad C : Um , and that 's {disfmarker} now I 'm not going to bring that . So that 's basically what I have , so far , and the rest is for airplanes . So X - schemas , then , I would like to do {disfmarker} talk about the construction aspect and then at the end about our Bayes - net .
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Grad C : End of story . Anything I forgot that we should mention ? Oh , maybe the FMRI stuff . Should I mention the fact that , um , we 're also actually started {disfmarker} going to start to look at people 's brains in a more direct way ?
Professor E : You certainly can . I mean I y I you know , I don't know {disfmarker}
Grad A : You might just wanna like , tack that on , as a comment , to something .
Professor E : Right , um .
Grad C : "" Future activities "" something .
Professor E : Well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons , then you should talk about the more recent stuff , about the kicking
Grad C : Yeah .
Professor E : and , you know , the {disfmarker} yeah , yeah {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} that the plan is to see to what extent the {disfmarker} you 'll get the same phenomena with stories about this , so that {disfmarker}
Grad C : Mm - hmm .
Professor E : and that we 're planning to do this , um , which , we are . So that 's one thing . Um . Depends . I mean , there is a , um , whole language learning story , OK ?
Grad C : Yeah .
Professor E : which , uh , actually , i i even on your five - layer slide , you {disfmarker} you 've got an old one that {disfmarker} that leaves that off .
Grad C : Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I do have it here .
Grad A : Hmm .
Professor E : Yeah .
Grad C : Um . And , of course , you know , the {disfmarker} the big picture is this bit .
Professor E : Right .
Grad C : But , you know , it would {disfmarker} But I don't think I {disfmarker} I am capable of {disfmarker} of do pulling this off and doing justice to the matter . I mean , there is interesting stuff in her terms of how language works , so the emergentism story would be nice to be {disfmarker} you know , it would be nice to tell people how {disfmarker} what 's happening there , plus how the , uh , language learning stuff works ,
Professor E : OK , so , so anyway , I {disfmarker} I agree that 's not central .
Grad C : but {disfmarker}
Grad A : Mm - hmm .
Professor E : What you might wanna do is , um , and may not , but you might wanna {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} rip off a bunch of the slides on the anal there {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} we 've got various i generations of slides that show language analysis , and matching to the underlying image schemas , and , um , how the construction and simulation {disfmarker} that ho that whole th
Grad C : Yeah , th that {disfmarker} that 's c that comes up to the X - schema slide ,
Grad A : OK , right .
Grad C : so basically I 'm gonna steal that from Nancy ,
Grad A : OK , I can give you a more recent {disfmarker} if you want {disfmarker}
Grad C : one of Nancy 's st
Grad A : well , that might have enough .
Grad C : Uh , I {disfmarker} yeah , but I also have stuff you {disfmarker} trash you left over ,
Professor E : OK .
Grad C : your quals and your triple - AI .
Professor E : The quals w the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the quals slides would be fine .
Grad A : Yeah .
Professor E : You could get it out of there , or some
Grad A : Which I can even email you then , you know , like there probably was a little {disfmarker} few changes , not a big deal . Yeah , you could steal anything you want , I don't care . Which you 've already done , obviously . So . Sorry
Grad C : Well , I {disfmarker} I don't feel bad about it at all
Grad A : No , you shouldn't .
Grad C : because {disfmarker} because you are on the , uh , title .
Grad A : Oh , that 's great , that 's great .
Grad C : I mean on the {disfmarker} the , you 're {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} see , that 's you .
Grad A : I 'm glad to see propagation .
Professor E : Yeah . Yeah .
Grad A : Mmm .
Grad C : Hmm ? Propagated ?
Grad A : Yes .
Grad C : I mean I might even mention that this work you 're doing is sort of also with the MPI in Leipzig , so .
Grad A : It 's {disfmarker} it 's certainly related , um ,
Grad C : Because , um , EML is building up a huge thing in Leipzig .
Grad A : might wanna say . Is it ?
Grad C : So it {disfmarker} It 's on biocomputation . Would {disfmarker}
Professor E : Yeah , it 's different , this is the , uh , DNA building , or someth the double helix building .
Grad C : Yeah .
Professor E : Yeah .
Grad A : Kind of a different level of analysis .
Professor E : The {disfmarker} yeah it was {disfmarker} it turns out that if {disfmarker} if you have multiple billions of dollars , y you can do all sorts of weird things , and {disfmarker}
Grad D : Wait , they 're building a building in the shape of DNA ,
Grad A : What ?
Grad D : is that what you said ?
Professor E : Roughly , yeah .
Grad F : Oh ! Oh boy !
Grad A : O
Professor E : Including cr cross - bridges ,
Grad A : What ?
Professor E : and
Grad A : Oh my god !
Grad F : That 's brilliant ! Hhh .
Professor E : You d you really {disfmarker} now I I spent {disfmarker} the last time I was there I spent maybe two hours hearing this story which is , um {disfmarker}
Grad A : Of what
Grad D : Y You definitely wanna w don't wanna waste that money on research ,
Grad A : the building ?
Grad D : you know ?
Professor E : Right .
Grad D : That 's horrible .
Professor E : Right . Well , no , no , y i there 's infinite money . See you th you th you then fill it with researchers .
Grad A : And give them more money . They just want a fun place for them to {disfmarker} to work .
Professor E : Right . Right .
Grad F : And everybody gets a trampoline in their office .
Grad C : Well , the {disfmarker} the offices are actually a little {disfmarker} the , think of um , ramps , coming out of the double helix and then you have these half - domes , glass half - domes , and the offices are in {disfmarker} in the glass half - dome .
Grad A : Really ?
Professor E : Yeah .
Grad F : Alright , let 's stop talking about this .
Grad A : Does it exist yet ?
Professor E : Yeah .
Grad A : They are w now building it ?
Grad C : Uh , as a model .
Grad A : Hmm .
Grad C : But I th
Professor E : So , yeah , I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's a good point , th th that the date , the , uh , a lot of the {disfmarker} this is interacting with , uh , people in Italy but also definitely the people in Leipzig and the {disfmarker} the b the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , yeah . OK . OK . Anyway ! Enough of that , let 's talk about your thesis proposal .
Grad C : Yeah , if somebody has something to say .
Professor E : Yep .
Grad F : You might want to , uh , double - check the spellings of the authors ' names on your references , you had a few , uh , misspells in your slides , there . Like I believe you had "" Jackendorf "" .
Professor E : Um .
Grad F : Uh , unless there 's a person called "" Jackendorf "" ,
Grad A : On that one ?
Professor E : No , no , no .
Grad F : yeah . But that 's the only thing I noticed in there .
Grad A : In the presentation ?
Grad F : In the presentation .
Grad A : I 'll probably {disfmarker} I c might have {disfmarker} I 'll probably have comments for you separately , not important . Anyway .
Grad C : Oh , in the presentation here .
Grad A : Yeah , that 's what he was talking about .
Grad F : Yeah .
Grad C : I was ac actually worried about bibtex . Uh . No , that 's quite possible . That 's copy and paste from something .
Professor E : So I did note i i it looks like the , uh , metaphor didn't get in yet .
Grad C : Uh , it did , there is a reference to Srini {disfmarker}
Professor E : Well , s reference is one thing , the question is is there any place {disfmarker} Oh , did you put in something about ,
Grad A : Metonymy and metaphor here , right ?
Professor E : uh , the individual , we 'd talked about putting in something about people had , uh {disfmarker} Oh yeah , OK . Good . I see where you have it . So the top of the second {disfmarker} of pa page two you have a sentence .
Grad C : Mm - hmm .
Professor E : But , what I meant is , I think even before you give this , to Wahlster , uh , you should , unless you put it in the text , and I don't think it 's there yet , about {disfmarker} we talked about is the , um , scalability that you get by , um , combining the constructions with the general construal mechanism . Is that in there ?
Grad C : Yeah , mmm . Um .
Professor E : Uh , OK , so where {disfmarker} where is it , cuz I 'll have to take a look .
Grad C : Um , but I {disfmarker} I did not focus on that aspect but , um {disfmarker} Ehhh , um , it 's just underneath , uh , um , that reference to metaphor . So it 's the last paragraph before two . So on page two , um , the main focus {disfmarker}
Professor E : Uh , OK . Yeah .
Grad C : But that 's really {disfmarker}
Grad A : That 's not about that , is it ?
Grad C : Yeah .
Professor E : No , it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it s says it but it doesn't say {disfmarker} it doesn't {disfmarker} it d it d
Grad C : Why .
Professor E : yeah , it doesn't give the punch line .
Grad C : Mm - hmm .
Professor E : Cuz let me tell the gang what I think the punch line is , because it 's actually important , which is , that , the constructions , that , uh , Nancy and Keith and friends are doing , uh , are , in a way , quite general but cover only base cases . And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . And the punch line is , he claimed , that if you do this right , you can get essentially orthogonality , that if you introduce a new construction at {disfmarker} at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work .
Grad F : Mm - hmm .
Professor E : And , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , it should then uh , compose with all of the constructions .
Grad F : Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Professor E : And it {disfmarker} to the extent that that 's true then {disfmarker} then it 's a big win over anything that exists .
Grad D : So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your context - free grammar you just have these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them .
Grad F : Yeah .
Professor E : Mm - hmm . So that , you know , for example , uh , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct idea of a source , path , and goal and any metaphorical one {disfmarker} and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff {comment} {disfmarker} you can do the same grammar .
Grad D : Mmm .
Professor E : And it is the same grammar . But , um , the trick is that the {disfmarker} the way the construction 's written it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container . Well , "" trouble "" isn't a container , but it gets constr construed as a c container .
Grad D : Right .
Professor E : Et cetera . So that 's {disfmarker} that 's where this , um ,
Grad D : So with construal you don't have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule .
Professor E : Right . So 's it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's a very big deal , i i in this framework , and the thesis proposal as it stands doesn't , um , I don't think , say that as clearly as it could .
Grad C : No , it doesn't say it at all . No . Even though {disfmarker} {vocalsound} One could argue what {disfmarker} if there are basic cases , even . I mean , it seems like nothing is context - free .
Professor E : Oh , nothing is context - free , but there are basic cases . That is , um , there are physical containers , there are physical paths , there {disfmarker} you know , et cetera .
Grad C : But "" walked into the cafe and ordered a drink , "" and "" walked into the cafe and broke his nose , "" that 's sort of {disfmarker}
Professor E : Oh , it doesn't mean that they 're unambiguous .
Grad C : Mmm . Yeah .
Professor E : I mean , a cafe can be construed as a container , or it can be construed you know as {disfmarker} as a obstacle ,
Grad F : Uh - huh .
Professor E : or as some physical object . So there are multiple construals . And in fact that 's part of what has to be done . This is why there 's this interaction between the analysis and the construal .
Grad C : Mm - hmm . Yep .
Professor E : The b the {disfmarker} the double arrow .
Grad C : Yep .
Professor E : So , uh , yeah , I mean , it doesn't magically make ambiguity go away .
Grad C : No .
Professor E : But it does say that , uh , if you walked into the cafe and broke your nose , then you are construing the cafe as an obstacle .
Grad C : Mm - hmm .
Professor E : And if that 's not consistent with other things , then you 've gotta reject that reading .
Grad C : Yep .
Grad D : You con {disfmarker} you conditioned me with your first sentence , and so I thought , "" Why would he walk into the cafe and then somehow break his nose ? "" uh , oh , uh {disfmarker}
Grad F : He slipped on the wet floor .
Professor E : Right .
Grad C : You don't find that usage , uh {disfmarker} uh , I checked for it in the Brown national corpus .
Professor E : Yeah .
Grad C : The "" walk into it "" never really means , w as in walked smack {disfmarker}
Professor E : But "" run into "" does .
Grad C : Yeah , but , y y if you find "" walked smacked into the cafe "" or "" slammed into the wall "" {disfmarker}
Professor E : Yeah , no , but "" run into "" does .
Grad C : Mm - hmm .
Professor E : Because you will find "" run into , "" uh ,
Grad D : Cars run into telephone poles all the time .
Professor E : well , or "" into the cafe "" for that m
Grad C : Right .
Professor E : you know {disfmarker} "" His car ran into the cafe . ""
Grad C : Yeah . Or you can run into an old friend , or run .
Professor E : Well , you can "" run into "" in that sense too .
Grad A : Yeah , "" run into "" might even be more impact sense than , you know , container sense .
Professor E : But , uh , Right .
Grad F : Depends .
Professor E : But {disfmarker} Like , "" run into an old friend "" , it probably needs its own construction . I mean , uh , you know , George would have I 'm sure some exa complicated ex reason why it really was an instance of something else
Grad A : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Professor E : and maybe it is , but , um , there are idioms and my guess is that 's one of them , but , um {disfmarker} I don't know .
Grad A : All contact . I mean , there there 's contact that doesn't {disfmarker} social contact , whatever . I mean .
Professor E : Uh .
Grad F : Sudden surprising contact ,
Professor E : Yeah , but it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} Right . i Yeah , it 's more {disfmarker}
Grad F : right ?
Grad A : Forceful .
Grad F : But of course , no , i i I mean it has a life of its own . It 's sort of partially inspired by the spatial {disfmarker}
Professor E : Well , this is this motivated {disfmarker} but yeah {disfmarker}
Grad F : Yeah .
Professor E : oh yeah , mo for sure , motivated , but then you can't parse on motivated .
Grad F : Yeah . Yeah . Right .
Professor E : Uh ,
Grad A : Too bad .
Grad D : You should get a T - shirt that says that .
Professor E : OK .
Grad A : There 's {disfmarker} there 's lots of things you could make T - shirts out of , but , uh , this has gotten {disfmarker} I mean wh We don't need the words to that .
Grad C : Pro - probably not your marks in the kitchen , today .
Grad A : What ? Oh , no no no no no no no no no , we 're not going there .
Grad C : Not {disfmarker} not your marks .
Grad A : OK .
Professor E : OK , so , um ,
Grad F : In other news .
Professor E : anything else you want to ask us about the thesis proposal , you got {disfmarker}
Grad C : Well ,
Professor E : We could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it .
Grad C : Well there {disfmarker} actually {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} i what would have been really nice is to find an example for all of this , uh , from our domain . So maybe if we w if we can make one up {pause} now , that would be c incredibly helpful .
Grad A : So , w where it should illustrate
Professor E : OK .
Grad A : uh {disfmarker} wh when you say all this , do you mean , like , I don't know , the related work stuff ,
Grad C : How {disfmarker}
Grad A : as well as , mappings ?
Grad C : w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something
Professor E : Right {disfmarker} right {disfmarker} r
Grad C : and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions and then it 's construed as something , and then we {disfmarker} we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that 's also relevant to the {disfmarker} to the domain .
Professor E : OK , f let 's {disfmarker} let 's suppose you use "" in "" and "" on "" . I mean , that 's what you started with .
Grad C : Mm - hmm .
Professor E : So "" in the bus "" and "" on the bus , "" um , that 's actually a little tricky in English because to some extent they 're synonyms . OK .
Grad C : I had two hours w with George on this , so it ,
Professor E : OK , what did he say .
Grad A : Did you ?
Grad C : um {disfmarker} Um .
Grad A : Join the club .
Professor E : Right . Oh , h that 's {disfmarker}
Grad C : "" On the bus "" is a m is a metaphorical metonymy that relates some meta path metaphorically and you 're on {disfmarker} on that path and th w I mean it 's {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} there 's a platform notion ,
Professor E : Yeah , I {disfmarker} I believe all that , it 's just {disfmarker}
Grad C : right ? "" he 's on the {disfmarker} standing on the bus waving to me . ""
Professor E : Yeah .
Grad C : But th the regular as we speak "" J Johno was on the bus to New York , ""
Professor E : Yeah . Yeah .
Grad C : um , uh , he 's {disfmarker} that 's , uh , what did I call it here , the transportation schema , something ,
Professor E : Yeah .
Grad C : where you can be on the first flight , on the second flight ,
Professor E : Yeah .
Grad C : and you can be , you know , on the wagon .
Professor E : Right . So {disfmarker} so that {disfmarker} that may or may not be what you {disfmarker} what you want to do . I mean you could do something much simpler
Grad C : Yeah .
Professor E : like "" under the bus , "" or something , where {disfmarker}
Grad C : But it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} unfortunately , this is not really something a tourist would ever say . So .
Professor E : Well , unless he was repairing it or something ,
Grad C : Yeah .
Professor E : but yeah .
Grad C : But um .
Professor E : Uh , but OK .
Grad C : So in terms of the {disfmarker} this {disfmarker}
Grad A : I see .
Grad C : We had {disfmarker} we had {disfmarker} initially we 'd {disfmarker} started discussing the "" out of film . ""
Professor E : Right .
Grad C : And there 's a lot of "" out of "" analysis , so , um ,
Professor E : Right .
Grad C : could we capture that with a different construal of {disfmarker}
Grad A : Yeah , it 's a little {disfmarker} it 's , uh {disfmarker} we 've thought about it before , uh t uh {disfmarker} to use the examples in other papers , and it 's {disfmarker} it 's a little complicated . Cuz you 're like , it 's a state of {disfmarker} there 's resource ,
Grad F : Out of {disfmarker} out of film , in particular .
Grad A : right , and like , what is film ,
Grad F : Yeah .
Grad A : the state {disfmarker} you know . You 're out of the state of having film , right ? and somehow film is standing for the re the resour the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource .
Grad F : It 's {disfmarker}
Grad A : I mean .
Grad F : yeah , I mean ,
Grad A : It 's a little bit {disfmarker}
Grad F : but {disfmarker} and plus the fact that there 's also s I mean , can you say , like , "" The film ran out "" you know , or , maybe you could say something like "" The film is out ""
Grad A : Yeah , is film the trajector ?
Grad F : so like the {disfmarker} the film went away from where it should be , namely with you , or something , right ? You know . The {disfmarker} the film {disfmarker} the film is gone , right ? Um , I never really knew what was going on , I mean I {disfmarker} I find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that {disfmarker} that "" I 'm out of film "" means that I have left the state of having film or something like that ,
Grad A : It 's weird . That {disfmarker}
Grad F : but .
Grad A : Or , "" having "" is also , um , associated with location ,
Professor E : Uh .
Grad A : right ?
Grad F : Yeah . Yeah .
Grad A : so if the film left , you know {disfmarker} state is being near film .
Grad C : So running {disfmarker} running out of something is different from being out of somewhere .
Professor E : Or being out of something as , uh {disfmarker} as well . So "" running out of it "" definitely has a process aspect to it .
Grad A ";yes;5;yes;5;yes;2;yes;2;yes;3;no;0;yes;2
"Grad B : OK ,
PhD F : That 's looks strange .
Grad B : now we 're on and it seems to be working .
Postdoc E : Oh there we go .
PhD C : One two three four five six
PhD A : That is weird .
Postdoc E : This looks good .
PhD A : It 's like when it 's been sitting for a long time or something .
Grad B : So , I mean {disfmarker} I don't know what it is . But all {disfmarker} all I know is that it seems like every time I am up here after a meeting , and I start it , it works fine . And if I 'm up here and I start it and we 're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting , it gives me that error message and I have not yet sat down with {disfmarker} been able to get that error message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it 's occurring in the code .
PhD A : Next time you get it maybe we should write it down .
Grad B : Yep , we will . One of these days .
Professor D : Yeah .
Postdoc E : Was it a pause , or {disfmarker} ? OK . Was it on "" pause "" or something ?
Grad B : No .
Postdoc E : OK . Don't know .
Professor D : So uh {disfmarker} so the uh , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that um , we do the digit recordings at the end . And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's uh meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , uh , then they can run off . It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer uh , sets of digits , but um , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , um , if someone 's on strict time uh , less . So , I th I think {disfmarker} I think we should start doing that . Um , so , uh , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about uh , the nature of the data that we are collecting . uh @ @ that uh , we should have a fair amount of data that is um , collected for the same meeting , so that we can , uh {disfmarker} I don't know . Wh - what {disfmarker} what were some of the points again about that ? Is it {disfmarker}
PhD F : Uh , well , OK , I 'll back up .
Professor D : Yeah .
PhD F : Um , at the previous {disfmarker} at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping {vocalsound} about wanting to get more data and I {disfmarker} I talked about this with Jane and Adam , um , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um , since we 'll have a new {disfmarker} this new student di does wanna work with us ,
PhD A : Well , great .
PhD F : th the guy that was at the last meeting .
PhD A : Great .
PhD F : And he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time ,
PhD A : What a deal .
PhD F : uh {disfmarker} Yeah .
Grad B : And what 's he interested in , specifically ?
PhD F : So he 's {disfmarker} comes from a signal - processing background , but I liked him a lot cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody ,
Grad B : Mm - hmm . Great .
PhD F : so he 's just getting his feet wet in that . Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts {disfmarker} he 'd be starting in January , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with .
Grad B : Right .
PhD F : But , um , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible , um , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one {disfmarker} one - time {disfmarker}
Grad B : One offs ?
PhD F : Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses , both to get the , um {disfmarker} to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about . I mean it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth . So . Then I was um , talking to Morgan about some {pause} new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns , like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech , sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to {pause} listen to . And in that uh , regard , I thought we definitely w will need {disfmarker} it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings . So this {disfmarker} this meeting is one of them , although I 'm not sure I can participate if I {disfmarker} You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization .
Grad B : Mm - hmm .
PhD F : Um , and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned , like the front - end meeting {pause} and maybe a networking {pause} group meeting .
Grad B : Right . Yep . Yeah , we 're {disfmarker} we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly .
PhD F : So {disfmarker} So if that were the case then I think we 'd have enough .
Grad B : So . Mm - hmm .
PhD F : But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting {disfmarker} {comment} {pause} meaning out of the meeting , um , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize ,
Grad B : Yeah .
PhD F : but {disfmarker} rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries . And then we need a couple that {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} {pause} We don't wanna just have one group because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds .
Grad B : Yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting .
Professor D : S So {disfmarker}
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD F : See , I 've never listened to the data for the front - end {pause} meeting .
Grad B : Yeah , we {disfmarker} we 've only had three .
Professor D : Yeah .
Grad B : So .
PhD F : OK . But maybe that 's enough . So , in general , I was thinking more data but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar ,
Grad B : Mm - hmm .
PhD F : like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same .
Grad B : Um {disfmarker}
Professor D : Now , let {disfmarker} l l let me just give you the other side to that cuz I ca because I {disfmarker} I don't disagree with that , but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too . Uh , for other kinds of research , particularly the acoustic oriented research , I actually feel the opposite need . I 'd like to have lots of different people .
PhD F : Right . Right .
Professor D : As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view . I 'd like to have many different speakers . So , um I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and {disfmarker} and uh ,
PhD C : Mm - hmm .
Professor D : I mean , sure , if we can get more from them , fine ,
Postdoc E : Mm - hmm .
PhD F : Right .
Professor D : but if we only get one or two from each group , that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have close and distant microphones with different people .
PhD F : Yeah , I definitely agree with that .
PhD C : Yeah .
Postdoc E : Mm - hmm .
PhD F : Definitely .
PhD C : Yeah .
Postdoc E : Can I {disfmarker} can I say about that {disfmarker} that the {disfmarker} the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . Because I think if you just say {disfmarker} an And in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in English that {disfmarker} that uh , it would be useful for {disfmarker} for purposes {disfmarker} You know .
Professor D : Mm - hmm .
Postdoc E : But you know , I think I 've been {disfmarker} I 've I {disfmarker} I 've gathered data from undergrads at {disfmarker} on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . And {disfmarker} and the English you 'd have {disfmarker} The language models would be really hard to build
Professor D : Well , you want to i
Postdoc E : because it would not really be {disfmarker} it would be an interlanguage rather than {pause} than a {disfmarker}
Professor D : Well , OK , uh , first place , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , I think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I {disfmarker} I think that 's what we 're investigating ,
Postdoc E : OK .
PhD F : It has to be a {disfmarker} a pre - existing meeting , {pause} like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway .
Professor D : so
Grad B : Right .
Professor D : Yeah , yeah .
Postdoc E : OK .
Grad B : Yep .
Professor D : So I was {disfmarker} I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh , senior uh , uh , d and uh , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their {disfmarker} hold their meeting down here .
PhD F : That 's I think what we {disfmarker} and I agree with .
Postdoc E : Oh , interesting !
PhD C : Yeah .
Postdoc E : Oh , I see . Oh , interesting !
Professor D : Uh , that 's the first point . The second point is um I think that for some time now , going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and I th I think that {disfmarker}
Postdoc E : Oh , oh . I 'm not saying accents . u The accent 's not the problem .
Professor D : Oh , OK .
Postdoc E : No , it 's more a matter of uh , proficiency , e e just simply fluency .
Professor D : Yeah .
Postdoc E : I mean , I deal with people on {disfmarker} on campus who {disfmarker} I think sometimes people , undergraduates um in computer science uh , have language skills that make , you know {disfmarker} that their {disfmarker} their fluency and writing skills are not so strong .
Professor D : Oh ! You 're not talking about foreign language at all .
Grad B : Yeah . Yeah , just talking about .
Professor D : You 're just talking about {disfmarker}
Postdoc E : Well , e I just think ,
Grad B : We all had the same thought .
Postdoc E : but you know , it 's like when you get into the graduate level , uh , no problem . I mean , I 'm not saying accents .
PhD C : Uh - huh .
Professor D : Yeah , then we 're completely gone .
Postdoc E : I 'm say I 'm saying fluency .
Grad B : Mm - hmm .
Professor D : It 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The {disfmarker} the habits are already burnt in .
Postdoc E : Well , yeah . I 'm just saying fluency .
Professor D : But {disfmarker}
Grad B : Well , I think that , um {disfmarker} I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English . And {disfmarker} and I think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English , {comment} I {disfmarker} I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have uh , g particularly good English skills .
Professor D : Yeah .
Postdoc E : OK , now can I {disfmarker} can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that um , there 's {disfmarker} there 's this {disfmarker} this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for {disfmarker} for multiple things cuz it 's so expensive to put together .
Grad B : Right .
Professor D : Right .
Postdoc E : And if people want to approach {disfmarker} Um , i so I know {pause} e e {pause} You know this {disfmarker} The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group ,
Professor D : Uh - huh .
Postdoc E : but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking uh , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data ,
Professor D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Postdoc E : if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} um , i more fluent , more {disfmarker} more close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing .
Professor D : I guess {disfmarker} I maybe {disfmarker} Hmm . I
Postdoc E : Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have {disfmarker} Uh , so if {disfmarker} if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case . If you have people who are using English as a {disfmarker} as an interlanguage because they {disfmarker} they don't {disfmarker} uh , they can't speak in their native languages and {disfmarker} but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing , uh , language model ,
Professor D : Uh - huh .
Postdoc E : this is the worst case scenario .
PhD C : Yeah . Yeah .
Professor D : Well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group .
Postdoc E : And {disfmarker}
Grad B : Right .
Professor D : because {disfmarker} because they {disfmarker} most {disfmarker} the network group is almost entirely Germans and Spaniards .
Postdoc E : Well Oh . But the thing is , I think that these people are of high enough level in their {disfmarker} in their language proficiency that {disfmarker}
Professor D : I see .
Postdoc E : And I 'm not objecting to accents .
Professor D : OK .
Postdoc E : I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm just thinking that we have to think at a {disfmarker} at a higher level view , could we have a language model , a {disfmarker} a grammar {disfmarker} a grammar , basically , that um , wo would be a {disfmarker} a possibility .
Professor D : Uh - huh .
Postdoc E : So y so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky 's model , an and do some top - down stuff , it {disfmarker} to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , uh , it seems like um , I don't see that there 's an argument {disfmarker}
Professor D : Mm - hmm .
Postdoc E : I 'm {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I think is that why not have the corpus , since it 's so expensive to put together , uh , useful for the widest range of {disfmarker} of central corp things that people generally use corpora for and which are , you know , used in computational linguistics .
Professor D : Mm - hmm .
Postdoc E : That 's {disfmarker} that 's my point . Which {disfmarker} which includes both top - down and bottom - up .
PhD C : It 's difficult .
Professor D : OK .
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor D : OK , well , i i let 's {disfmarker} let 's see what we can get . I mean , it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} I think that if we 're aiming at {disfmarker} at uh , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it will be OK ,
Postdoc E : Yes , that 's fine . That 's fine . Exactly . And my point in m in my note to Liz was I think that undergrads are an iff iffy population .
Professor D : but {disfmarker} OK . OK .
PhD F : I definitely agree with that , I mean , for this purpose .
Professor D : OK .
Grad B : Well , not to mention the fact that I would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one .
PhD C : Yeah .
Postdoc E : Grads and professors , fine .
PhD C : Yeah .
Grad B : So .
Professor D : Oh , you age - ist !
Grad B : What 's that ? Well , age - ist . {comment} The "" eighteen "" is because of the consent form .
Postdoc E : Age - ist .
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD F : Right , Yeah .
Grad B : We 'd hafta get {disfmarker} find their parent to sign for them .
PhD C : "" Age - ist "" . Yeah . Yeah .
Professor D : Yes .
Postdoc E : Yeah , that 's true .
Grad B : So .
PhD F : I have a {disfmarker} uh , um , question . Well , Morgan , you were mentioning that Mari may not use the k equipment from IBM if they found something else , cuz there 's a {disfmarker}
Professor D : They 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} yeah , they 're d they 're uh {disfmarker} assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks .
PhD F : Cuz I mean , one remote possibility is that if we st if we inherited that equipment , if she weren't using it , could we set up a room in the linguistics department ? And {disfmarker} and I mean , there {disfmarker} there may be a lot more {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or in psych , or in comp wherever , in another building where we could um , record people there . I think we 'd have a better chance
Grad B : I think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that . We 'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this .
PhD F : Right , but {disfmarker} Right . But if there were such a {disfmarker} I mean it 's a remote possibility , then um , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here .
Grad B : Yep .
PhD F : So it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the {disfmarker} the hardware .
Professor D : Well , the other thing {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around .
Grad B : Right .
Professor D : Uh . But . Um , and {disfmarker}
Grad B : Well , I know that space is really scarce on {disfmarker} at least in CS . You know , to {disfmarker} to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult .
Professor D : Uh {disfmarker} Yeah .
PhD F : But you may not need a separate room , you know ,
Grad B : That 's true .
Professor D : Yeah .
PhD F : the idea is , if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth , and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something {disfmarker}
Grad B : True . Mm - hmm . Yep .
Professor D : Well , maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something .
PhD F : Huh .
Grad B : Yep .
Professor D : You know .
PhD F : I {disfmarker} I think it 's not out of the question .
Grad B : Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting .
Professor D : Yeah .
PhD F : Um . So .
Grad B : another type of meeting .
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD F : Right .
PhD C : But I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think you need , uh , another portable thing a another portable equipment to {disfmarker} to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI .
PhD F : Right .
Grad B : Hmm .
Professor D : Yeah .
Grad B : Right .
PhD C : Eh and probably . I don't know .
Professor D : Yeah .
PhD C : Eh , if you {disfmarker} you want to {disfmarker} to record , eh , a seminar or a class , eh , in the university , you {disfmarker} you need {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It - it would be eh eh very difficult to {disfmarker} to put , {vocalsound} eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when you have to {disfmarker} to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device .
Professor D : Yeah .
Grad B : Yeah , but {disfmarker} I think if we {disfmarker} if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy .
PhD C : Oh - yeah .
Grad B : Right ? That 's very easy ,
PhD C : Ye - Yeah , yeah .
Grad B : but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting .
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor D : Actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . We realized that , um , when we were talking about this that , OK , there 's these different things that we want to do with it . So , um , it 's true that we wanna be selective in some ways , uh , the way that you were speaking about with , uh , not having an interlingua and uh , these other issues . But on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it . So , a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , uh , typ number of types of meetings But we can also have another part that 's , uh , just one or two meetings of each of a {disfmarker} of a range of them and that 's OK too . Uh , i We realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ? I mean , we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way , that 's why we did it . But {pause} what about {disfmarker} For th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone .
PhD F : Right , I mean , I c I think there 's {disfmarker}
Grad B : And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean .
Professor D : You actually don't .
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD F : Yea - yeah yeah , you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone .
Postdoc E : Which one did you mean ?
Professor D : You d You don't ne it doesn't {disfmarker} you just need some microphone , somewhere .
Grad B : Ye - Yeah . Yep .
PhD F : You can use found data .
Grad B : Tape recorder .
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor D : Yeah .
Postdoc E : Oh .
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD F : You {disfmarker} you can .
Professor D : You need some microphone ,
PhD F : You can
Grad B : Mm - hmm .
Professor D : but I mean {disfmarker}
PhD F : use {disfmarker} Um , but I think that any {pause} data that we spend a lot of effort {nonvocalsound} to collect ,
Professor D : Yeah .
PhD F : you know , each person who 's interested in {disfmarker} I mean , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , um , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , um , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want .
Professor D : Right .
PhD F : And {disfmarker} So in my case , um , I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others .
Grad B : Not enough for others , right .
PhD F : And so {nonvocalsound} I 'm looking and thinking , "" Well I 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so {nonvocalsound} forth if it 's {disfmarker} to help th in my interest . ""
Grad B : Mm - hmm .
PhD F : And other people need to do that for themselves , uh , h or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal {disfmarker}
Professor D : Right . So that {disfmarker}
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor D : But I think that {disfmarker} I 'm raising that cuz I think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , "" Well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , "" well maybe you don't .
Grad B : Yeah . For some of it .
Professor D : Maybe if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} If really all you want is to have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a recording that 's good enough to get a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , a transcription from later , you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording .
PhD F : Right .
Grad B : Yep .
Professor D : I mean , we {disfmarker} we could have a fairly {disfmarker} We could just get a DAT machine and {disfmarker}
PhD F : Well , I agree with {nonvocalsound} Jane , though , on the other hand that {disfmarker}
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD F : So that might be true , you may say for instance , summarization , or something that sounds very language oriented . You may say well , "" Oh yeah , you just do that from transcripts of a radio show . "" I mean , you don't even need the speech signal .
Professor D : Right .
PhD F : But what you {disfmarker} what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on um {disfmarker} Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . There 's lots of cues you 're not gonna have .
Grad B : Right .
Professor D : Yeah .
PhD F : So I {pause} do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of {disfmarker} of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful .
PhD C : Yeah .
Grad B : Special ? Yep .
Professor D : I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I agree .
PhD F : Otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose {disfmarker} individual studies , so {disfmarker}
Professor D : Uh but I {disfmarker} I think that the uh {vocalsound} i We can't really underestimate the difficulty {disfmarker} shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up .
Grad B : Yep .
Professor D : And so , {disfmarker} uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say , "" Oh , we 'll just do it up there , "" {disfmarker}
PhD F : OK .
Professor D : If you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away . Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here , it won't happen quickly , it won't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know {vocalsound} keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o
PhD F : So then maybe we should {nonvocalsound} {pause} try to bring people here .
Grad B : Here .
Professor D : I think the first priority should be to pry {comment} to get {disfmarker} try to get people to come here .
PhD F : I mean , that 's that 's {disfmarker} OK , so
Professor D : We 're set up for it .
Postdoc E : Mm - hmm .
Professor D : The room is {disfmarker} is really , uh , underused .
PhD F : OK .
Professor D : Uh {disfmarker}
PhD F : Right .
Postdoc E : I thought the free lunch idea was a great idea .
Grad B : Yeah , I thought so too .
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor D : Free lunch is good .
PhD F : Yeah , I {disfmarker} And I think we can get people to come here , that {disfmarker} But the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group so that you don't waste a lot of your time {nonvocalsound} and the overhead in bringing people down .
Postdoc E : Mm - hmm .
PhD A : No crunchy food .
Professor D : Yeah .
PhD F : So {disfmarker} {comment} Well , it would be {pause} lunch afterwards .
Grad B : Well , I was thinking , lunch after .
Postdoc E : Yeah .
PhD F : Right . And they 'd have to do their digits or they don't get dessert .
Grad B : Yep .
Professor D : Yeah , they have to do their digits or they don't {comment} get {disfmarker} they don't {comment} get their food .
PhD F : Yeah .
Grad B : Um , I had a {disfmarker} I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered .
Professor D : Yeah
Grad B : Should I pursue that ?
PhD F : Oh , definitely , yeah .
Grad B : Yeah . So . They {disfmarker} they originally {disfmarker} They 've decided not to do {disfmarker} go into speech .
Professor D : Yeah .
Grad B : So I 'm not sure whether they 'll still be so willing to volunteer , but I 'll send an email and ask .
Professor D : Tell them about the free lunch .
Grad B : I 'll tell them about the free lunch .
PhD F : Yeah .
Grad B : And they 'll say there 's no such thing .
PhD F : Yeah .
Grad B : So .
PhD F : I 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers , cuz these are both weird {disfmarker}
Grad B : Right .
Professor D : Yeah .
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor D : The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The oth the other h
PhD F : well , I know , I shouldn't say that .
Grad B : That 's alright . No , the they {disfmarker} they 're very weird .
PhD F : We need a wider sampling .
PhD A : "" Beep . ""
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor D : Uh , "" beep ""
Grad B : The problem with engineers is "" beep . ""
Professor D : Uh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} They make funny sounds . The o the o the other {disfmarker} The other thing is , uh , that we {disfmarker} we talked about is give to them {disfmarker} uh , burn an extra CD - ROM .
Grad B : Yep . Let them have their meeting .
Professor D : and give them {disfmarker} So if they want a {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} basically and audio record of their {disfmarker}
PhD F : Well , I thought that was {disfmarker} I thought he meant , "" Give them a music CD , "" like they g {vocalsound} Then he said a CD of the {disfmarker} of their speech
Professor D : Oh .
PhD F : and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you 're talking to , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You know , I personally {nonvocalsound} would not want a {nonvocalsound} CD {comment} of my meeting ,
Grad B : Mmm . Of the meeting ?
PhD F : but {vocalsound} maybe {disfmarker} yeah , {pause} maybe you 're
Professor D : If you 're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you 'd like {disfmarker}
PhD F : right . {comment} Right . Right .
PhD A : Oh , that 's a good idea .
Grad B : It 'd be fun . I think it would just be fun , you know , if nothing else , you know .
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor D : Yeah .
PhD F : Right .
Grad B : It 's a novelty item .
Professor D : But it als It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it also I think builds up towards the goal .
PhD F : Right .
Professor D : We 're saying , "" Look , you know , you 're gonna get this . Is - is isn't that neat . Then you 're gonna go home with it . It 's actually p It 's probably gonna be pretty useless to you ,
Grad B : Yep .
Professor D : but you 'll ge appreciate , you know , where it 's useful and where it 's useless ,
PhD F : Right .
Professor D : and then , we 're gonna move this technology , so it 'll become useful . ""
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor D : So .
PhD F : No , I think that 's a great idea , actually .
PhD A : What if you could tell them that you 'll give them the {disfmarker} the transcripts when they come back ?
Postdoc E : Alth
PhD F : But we might need a little more to incentivize them , {comment} that 's all .
Grad B : Oh , yeah . I mean , anyone can have the transcripts . So . I thought we could point that out .
Professor D : Oh yeah .
Postdoc E : Yeah .
PhD F : Well , that 's interesting .
Postdoc E : I hav I have to uh raise a little eensy - weensy concern about doing th giving them the CD immediately , because of these issues of , you know , this kind of stuff , {comment} where maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You know ?
Professor D : Good point . That 's a very good point .
Postdoc E : So .
Professor D : So we can {disfmarker} so we can {disfmarker}
Postdoc E : We could burn it after it 's been cleared with the transcript stage .
Professor D : r Right .
Postdoc E : And then they {disfmarker} they get a CD , but just not the same day .
PhD F : Oh , right .
Grad B : Yeah , that 's right .
PhD F : If {disfmarker} It should be the same CD - ROM that we distribute publically ,
Grad B : That 's a good point . Right , it can't be the internal one .
PhD F : right ?
Professor D : Although it 's {disfmarker}
PhD F : Otherwise they 're not allowed to play it for anyone .
Postdoc E : There we go .
Grad B : That 's right .
Postdoc E : Oh , I like that . Well put . Well put . So , after the transcript screening phase .
Grad B : Yeah , that 's true .
Postdoc E : Things have been weeded out .
PhD F : Otherwise we 'd need two lawyer stages .
Postdoc E : Yeah , that 's right , say {comment} "" Yeah , well , I got this CD , and , Your Honor , I {disfmarker} ""
Grad B : Yeah .
PhD F : That 's a good point .
Professor D : Yeah so that 's {disfmarker} so let 's start with Haas , and Yeah .
PhD F : Sorry to have to {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} Sorry I have to {pause} leave .
Professor D : Oh , that 's fine .
PhD F : I will be here full - time next week .
Grad B : OK , see you .
Professor D : OK .
Grad B : No . Bye .
Professor D : That 's alright .
PhD A : See you .
Professor D : OK .
PhD C : See you .
Professor D : So , uh {disfmarker} Let 's see . So that was that topic , and {vocalsound} then um , I guess another topic would be {vocalsound} where are we in the whole disk resources {pause} question for {disfmarker}
Grad B : We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp room to ";yes;3;yes;3;yes;2;yes;2;yes;3;no;0;yes;3
"Professor E : Alright .
Grad C : So are you {disfmarker}
Professor E : So .
Grad C : Are we going ?
Professor E : It is uh , must be February fifteenth .
Postdoc F : Yeah .
Grad C : Yu I think the date 's written in there , yep . And actually if everyone could cross out the R - nine next to "" Session "" , and write MR eleven .
Professor E : Yeah . Yeah . We didn't have a front - end meeting today .
Grad C : And let 's remember also to make sure that one 's {comment} gets marked as unread , unused .
Professor E : OK .
PhD A : MR eleven .
Grad C : MR eleven .
Postdoc F : That sounds like a spy code .
Professor E : Mmm . OK . So .
Grad C : There 's lots of clicking I 'm sure as I 'm trying to get this to work {pause} correctly .
Professor E : Agenda . Any agenda items today ?
Grad C : I wanna talk a little bit about getting {disfmarker} how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps , parts of the meeting that they don't want to include . What I 've done so far , and I wanna get some opinions on , how to {disfmarker} how to finish it up .
Professor E : OK .
Postdoc F : I wanna ask about um , some aud audio monitoring on some of the {pause} um {pause} well some of the equipment . In particular , the {disfmarker} well uh , that 's just what I wanna ask .
Professor E : OK audio monitoring , Jane .
Postdoc F : Ba - based on some of the tran uh {disfmarker} i In listening to {pause} some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , and in pact {disfmarker} in fact this one I 'm talking on is one of {disfmarker} of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings ,
Grad C : Oh really .
Postdoc F : so I {disfmarker}
PhD B : "" Spikes "" , you mean like uh , instantaneous click type spikes , or {disfmarker} ?
Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . Yeah .
PhD A : Spikes ?
Grad C : Clicks .
Postdoc F : Yeah .
Professor E : Hmm .
Postdoc F : Yeah .
PhD B : Huh .
Postdoc F : And I don't know what the e electronics is but .
Grad C : Yeah .
Postdoc F : Yeah .
Grad C : Well , I think it 's
PhD A : Touching .
Grad C : uh , it {disfmarker} it could be a number of things .
PhD A : Yeah .
Grad C : It could be touching and fiddling , and the other thing is that it could {disfmarker} the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . It might be a connector .
Postdoc F : Oh , OK . Well maybe {disfmarker} Then we don't really have to talk about that as an {disfmarker}
PhD B : You could try an experiment and say "" OK , I 'm about to test for spikes "" ,
Postdoc F : I {disfmarker} I take that off the agenda .
PhD B : and then wiggle the thing there , and then go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you .
Grad C : Yeah . Right .
PhD B : "" Come get me when you transcribe this and see if there 's spikes . ""
Postdoc F : Oh that {disfmarker}
Professor E : Um .
Postdoc F : Well , OK .
PhD B : No I 'm just {disfmarker} 
Professor E : I mean , were this a professional audio recording , {vocalsound} what we would do {disfmarker} {comment} what you would do is {disfmarker} in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that things are not giving that kind of performance . And if they are , then they can't be used .
Grad C : Right .
Professor E : So . Um . Let 's see . I guess {pause} I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus .
Postdoc F : Good .
Professor E : And then um , the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , I think , deal is , uh , agendas . So maybe I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll start with that actually . Uh , um . {vocalsound} Andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point , and if there 's gonna be a topic about {disfmarker} discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come and {disfmarker} And I think part of {disfmarker} part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , in the {disfmarker} because of uh the fact that the meetings are {disfmarker} are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing {disfmarker}
Grad C : Mmm .
Professor E : and {disfmarker} and I 'm sure help out his own time . by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} So , uh in order {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} I think that this is a wish on his part . Uh . It 's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Grad C : Right .
Professor E : But um , we could try anyway , uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting , uh , say the day before .
Grad C : Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to {pause} like on Wednesday , or Tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items .
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor E : OK . You {disfmarker} you wanna volunteer to do that ?
Grad C : Sure .
Professor E : OK . Alright so we 'll send out agenda request .
Grad C : Let me
Professor E : Uh .
PhD B : That 'll be {disfmarker} I think that 'll help {disfmarker}
Grad C : I 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not {pause} get done .
PhD B : That 'll help a lot , actually .
Professor E : Yeah , I have to tell you for the uh {disfmarker} for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting . And uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting . But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} {comment} But . Uh . {comment} But we can try . Maybe it 'll work .
PhD B : Mmm .
Grad C : Yeah . Maybe . Weirder things have happened .
Professor E : Yeah .
Postdoc F : I 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , I mean . Maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more .
PhD B : I would {disfmarker} I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him .
Grad C : Well then {disfmarker}
Professor E : Yeah . Actually it {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} this maybe brings up another topic which is um {disfmarker} So we 're done with that topic . The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that .
Grad C : Yeah , actually I {disfmarker} I was going to say we need to {pause} talk about that too .
Professor E : Yeah . Why {disfmarker} why don't we do that .
Grad C : OK . Um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . Um . {pause} And they are being assembled as we speak , I hope . And I didn't bring my car today so I 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow . Um , and then the other question I was thinking about is {disfmarker} well , a couple things . First of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in ,
PhD A : 
Grad C : and get people 's opinions on {disfmarker} on what they think of them . Um , then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless . Another wireless setup . I mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be {pause} better than the wired .
Professor E : So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ?
Grad C : Um , well , I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes .
Professor E : So , um .
Grad C : And {disfmarker} So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six .
Professor E : So let 's see we {disfmarker}
Grad C : Right ? So we could have up to nine .
Professor E : And right now we can have up to six .
Grad C : Right . And we have five , we 're getting one more .
Professor E : Yeah .
Grad C : And it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , and then eight hundred per channel .
Professor E : Oh . So yeah so the only {disfmarker} Beyond the mike {disfmarker} the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars .
Grad C : Right .
Professor E : Oh , we should do it .
Grad C : OK . OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and {disfmarker} and then just go ahead and order them .
Professor E : Yeah . Yeah .
PhD B : I don't quite understand how that {disfmarker} how that works , . If {disfmarker} So we 're not increasing the number of channels . OK .
Grad C : No , we 're just replacing the wired {disfmarker} the two wired that are still working ,
PhD B : OK . I see .
Grad C : along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless .
Professor E : Yeah .
PhD B : Three wireds work ,
Professor E : Basically we found {disfmarker}
PhD B : right ?
Grad C : I {disfmarker} I guess three wireds work , yeah .
PhD B : Yeah . Yeah .
Professor E : Yeah . But we 've had more problems with that .
Grad C : Yep .
Professor E : And that sort of bypasses the whole {disfmarker} the whole Jimbox thing and all that .
Grad C : Right .
Professor E : And so um , we {disfmarker} we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries .
Grad C : Right .
Professor E : That seems to be the key issue .
Grad C : Everyone 's battery OK ?
PhD B : I checked them this morning , they should be .
Grad C : OK .
Professor E : Yeah . Um , {vocalsound} That 's the only thing with them . But the quality seems really good and {disfmarker} Um I heard from UW that they 're {disfmarker} they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . They 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf .
Grad C : Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone {disfmarker} on the same page with that .
Professor E : Yeah .
PhD B : SRI , really ?
Grad C : Yeah .
PhD B : Oh .
Grad C : They got sa apparent Well , Maybe {pause} this needs to be bleeped out ? I have no clue .
Professor E : Uh , I don't know .
Grad C : I don't know how much of it 's public .
Professor E : Probably we shouldn't {disfmarker} probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff .
Grad C : Right .
Professor E : Yeah . But anyway there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and NIST and UW . So . Um . But {disfmarker} but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is {disfmarker} is quite positive with the Sony ,
Grad C : Right .
Professor E : uh , radio - mikes . Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , right ?
Grad C : Uh , no , we 're having the {disfmarker} them do it .
Professor E : No ?
Grad C : So it 's so hand - soldering it , but I 'm not doing it .
Professor E : Oh .
Grad C : So , they {disfmarker} they charge
Professor E : OK . Nothing against you and your hand - soldering
Grad C : right .
Professor E : but {disfmarker}
Grad C : You 've never seen my hand - soldering . But uh , a as I said they 're coming in .
Professor E : Uh , OK , so that 's being done professionally and {disfmarker}
Grad C : I {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker}
Professor E : Yeah .
Grad C : Yeah . I mean .
Professor E : Yeah .
Grad C : As professionally as I guess you can get it done .
Professor E : Well , it could {disfmarker} if they do a lot of it , it 's {disfmarker}
Grad C : I mean i it 's just their repair shop . Right ? Their maintenance people .
Professor E : Well , we 'll see what it {disfmarker} it 's like .
Grad C : Yep .
Professor E : That {disfmarker} tha that can be quite good . Th - this {disfmarker} Yeah , OK . Good . Yeah . So let 's go with that .
Grad C : And , I mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like .
Professor E : Uh , Yeah . So , um , uh , Dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . Uh , so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that . I guess {disfmarker} Was {disfmarker} the decision last time was that the {disfmarker} the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? Has that started , or is that {disfmarker} ?
Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . Yeah . Uh , it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that .
Grad C : Right , so , the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . So I did the {disfmarker} all that last week . So all the {disfmarker} all the forms are now {pause} on the computer . And uh , then I have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the uh {pause} transcribers use different tools . And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those .
Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . So he has a nice set up that they {disfmarker} it w it will be efficient for them to do that .
Professor E : OK .
Grad C : I {disfmarker} I don't think it 'll take too long .
Professor E : So anyway {disfmarker}
Grad C : So , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days I suspect .
Professor E : So anyway I think we {disfmarker} we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave .
Grad C : Right . I 've already done five or six {pause} sets .
Postdoc F : OK .
Grad C : So if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could . You know , and I also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate P - files and run recognition on them also .
Professor E : Yeah , he might {disfmarker} he might be asking {disfmarker} Right . OK . Uh , is Dave {disfmarker} I don't know if Dave is on the list , if he 's invited to these meetings , uh if he knows .
Postdoc F : I don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even .
PhD A : No , no .
Grad C : Uh , we don't have a active one but I 'll make sure he 's on the list .
Postdoc F : Yeah . Should we call him ? I mean is he {disfmarker} d is he definitely not available today ?
Professor E : I don't know .
Postdoc F : Should I call his office and see ?
PhD A : He was in .
Grad C : I mean , he 's still taking classes , so uh , he may well have conflicts .
Professor E : Uh , well i it 's uh {disfmarker}
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor E : Yeah .
PhD A : Yeah , he was in {pause} s
Postdoc F : He wasn't there at cof
Professor E : Yeah , so this might be a conflict for him .
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor E : Yeah .
Postdoc F : OK .
Professor E : OK . Uh , so .
Grad C : Yeah didn't he say his signal - processing class was like {pause} Tuesdays and Thursdays ?
PhD A : I think he has a class . Yeah .
PhD B : Yeah . He might have .
Grad C : Oh well , whatever .
Grad D : You talking about David Gelbart ?
Professor E : Oh , OK .
PhD A : Yeah .
PhD B : Yeah .
Grad C : Yeah .
Professor E : Yeah .
Postdoc F : Yes .
Grad D : Yeah , I think he 's taking two twenty - five A which is now .
PhD B : Yeah .
Grad D : So .
Professor E : Yeah .
Postdoc F : OK .
Professor E : OK . So , that 's why we 're not seeing him . OK . Uh , transcriptions , uh , beyond the digits , where we are , and so on .
Postdoc F : OK .
Professor E : And the {disfmarker} and the recordings also ,
Postdoc F : Um {disfmarker}
Professor E : just where we are . Yeah .
Postdoc F : Well , so um , should we {disfmarker} we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or {disfmarker} ?
Grad C : Well , we have about thirty - two hours uh as of , I guess a week and a half ago , so we probably now have about thirty - five hours .
Professor E : And {disfmarker} and that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker} How much of that is digits ? It 's uh {disfmarker} that 's including digits ,
Grad C : That 's including digits .
Professor E : right ?
Grad C : I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits .
Professor E : So {disfmarker} Yeah . So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , or something of {disfmarker} There 's got to be more than thirty hour {disfmarker}
PhD A : Mmm .
Grad C : Of {disfmarker} of non - digits ?
Professor E : i it couldn't {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} Of non - digits .
Grad C : Yeah , absolutely . I mean , the digits don't take up that much time .
Professor E : Yeah , yeah . OK .
Postdoc F : OK , and the transcribers h I , uh , don't have the exact numbers , but I {pause} think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . The next step is to {disfmarker} that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . What I mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , Liz requested in terms of um , um {pause} in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about . Um , for example , i they 'll say uh "" ninety - two "" . And you know , so how {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker}
Grad C : Nine two ,
Postdoc F : e Exactly .
Grad C : right .
Postdoc F : So if you just say "" nine two "" , the {disfmarker} there are many s ways that could have been expressed . An - and I just had them {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things .
PhD B : You know , Jane ?
Grad C : Mm - hmm .
PhD B : Um , one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in {disfmarker} in order to build lexicons and things , if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , {comment} a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of {pause} inconsistencies and mis
Grad C : Misspelled .
PhD A : Yeah .
Postdoc F : You 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and I use those too . Y you mean just uh {pause} on each {disfmarker} on each line there 's a one word right ? It 's one token from the {disfmarker} from the corpus .
PhD B : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Postdoc F : Yeah , those are e extremely efficient and I and I {disfmarker} I agree that 's a very good use of it .
PhD B : Oh so you already have that , OK .
Postdoc F : Well that 's {disfmarker} that 's a way {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} You know , the spell - check basically does that but {disfmarker} but in addition {disfmarker} yes , that 's {disfmarker} that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon .
PhD B : Mm - hmm . Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh ,
Postdoc F : Exactly . And then you ca then you can do a s
PhD A : Yeah .
PhD B : i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and {disfmarker} and so it makes it easier .
Postdoc F : Absolutely . I agree . That 's a very good {disfmarker} that 's a very good uh , suggestion . And that was {disfmarker} that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed . I didn't get to that point but {disfmarker} So there are numbers , then there are acronyms , and then um , there 's a {disfmarker} he she wants the uh , actually a {disfmarker} an explicit marker of what type of comment this is , so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either "" VOC "" for vocalized , like cough or like laugh or whatever , "" NONVOC "" for door - slam , and "" GLOSS "" for things that have to do with {disfmarker} if they said a s a spoken form with this {disfmarker} m this pronunciation error .
Grad C : Right .
Postdoc F : I already had that convention
PhD B : Oh that 's great .
Postdoc F : but I {disfmarker} I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most {disfmarker} ha most efficiently handled by uh {disfmarker} by a {disfmarker} a filter . That was what I was always planing on . So that , you know you get a whole long list {disfmarker} exactly what you 're saying , you get a whole list of things that say "" curly bracket laugh curly bracket "" ,
PhD B : Mm - hmm .
Postdoc F : then y you know it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space ,
PhD B : Yeah .
Postdoc F : so man So many ways that error prone .
PhD B : Right . Right .
Postdoc F : So , um , {vocalsound} um I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged uh , subcategorized comments , and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying ,
PhD B : Mm - hmm .
Postdoc F : you end up with a s with uh , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens
PhD B : Mm - hmm .
Postdoc F : and you can um , have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes . But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand , because , you know I mean , jus
Grad C : You don't know what they could be .
PhD B : Yeah .
Postdoc F : Yeah now TIMIT 's clear um {pause} and PLP is clear but uh there are things that are not so well known , in {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or have variant {disfmarker} u u uses like the numbers you can say "" nine two "" or you can say "" ninety - two "" ,
Grad C : So how are you doing the {disfmarker}
Postdoc F : and uh I 'd handle the numbers individually .
Grad C : How are you doing the uh , acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript ?
Postdoc F : It would be separate {disfmarker} The letters would be separated in space
Grad C : OK .
Postdoc F : and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards e but I 'm not sure if that 's necessary , clarifying what it is ,
Grad C : Mm - hmm .
Postdoc F : so gloss of {pause} whatever .
Grad C : Right .
Postdoc F : I don't know if that 's really necessary to do that . Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there , and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's uh {vocalsound} the you know , {comment} uh enumerated , or i
Grad C : Mm - hmm .
Postdoc F : it 's not a good way of saying {disfmarker} but it 's {disfmarker} it 's the {vocalsound} specific uh way of stating these {disfmarker} these letters .
Grad C : Right . So it sounds good .
Postdoc F : And so anyway , the clean {disfmarker} those are those things and then channelized is to then um , get it into this multichannel format . And at that point then it 's ready for use by Liz and Don . But that 's been my top priority {disfmarker} beyond getting it tanel channelized , the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins .
PhD A : Yeah .
Grad C : Right .
Postdoc F : And uh , Thilo had a {disfmarker} e e a breakthrough with this {disfmarker} this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running and I haven't {disfmarker} I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I 'm working s re this is my top priority {disfmarker} get the data clean , and channelized .
PhD A : I actually gave
Grad C : Have you also been doing spot checks , Jane ?
Postdoc F : Oh yes .
Grad C : Okay , good .
Postdoc F : Well you see that 's part of the cleaning process . I spent um actually um I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers ,
Grad C : Oh good . Good .
Postdoc F : and I went through it last night , it 's {disfmarker} it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word . And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I {disfmarker} I left them discretion at commas .
Grad C : Right .
Postdoc F : Uh {disfmarker} and so because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions .
Professor E : Mm - hmm .
Postdoc F : And um , and {disfmarker} so they 'll be a difference in commas , but it 's word - by - word the same , in {disfmarker} in huge patches of the data . And I have t ten minute stretch where I can {disfmarker} where I can show that . And {disfmarker} and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . So um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up "" gobbledy - gook "" .
PhD B : Hmm .
Postdoc F : And the other one didn't . And on this side , this one 's picking up things like "" neural nets "" and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't .
Grad C : Right .
PhD B : When {disfmarker} for the person who missed "" gobbledy - gook "" what did they put ?
Postdoc F : It was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses , cuz I have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses .
PhD B : Oh .
Postdoc F : So they tried to approximate it , but it was {disfmarker}
PhD B : Oh good .
Postdoc F : it was spelled GABBL {disfmarker}
PhD B : Sort of how it sounds . Yeah .
Postdoc F : Yes . More of an attempt to {disfmarker} I mean apparently it was very clear to her that these {disfmarker} the a this {disfmarker} this was a sound {disfmarker} these are the sounds ,
Grad C : It was a technical term that she didn't recognize ,
PhD B : Yeah .
Postdoc F : but {disfmarker} Yeah . But she knew that she didn't know it . Maybe it was a technical ter exactly . But she {disfmarker} even though her technical perception is just really {disfmarker} uh you know I 've {disfmarker} I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses
Grad C : Right .
Postdoc F : then cuz "" neural nets "" and {disfmarker} oh she has some things that are {disfmarker} oh "" downsampled "" , she got that right .
PhD B : Hmm .
Postdoc F : And some of these are rather {pause} uh unexpected .
Grad C : Obscure , yeah .
Postdoc F : But ch ten solid uh {disfmarker} m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data .
Professor E : And {disfmarker} and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ?
Postdoc F : And um {disfmarker}
Professor E : Is that right ?
Postdoc F : Yes exactly .
Professor E : Yeah , OK .
Postdoc F : And that 's part of this {disfmarker} Eleven hours .
Professor E : Is that {disfmarker} is that {disfmarker} that including digits ? Yeah .
Postdoc F : Yes it is .
Professor E : So let 's say roughly {pause} ten hours or so of {disfmarker}
Postdoc F : Mm - hmm .
Professor E : I mean it 's probably more than that but {disfmarker} but with {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of non - digits .
PhD A : Yeah .
Postdoc F : It 'd be more than that because I {disfmarker} my recollection is the minutes {disfmarker} that da digits don't take more than half a minute . Per person .
Professor E : Oh , OK .
Postdoc F : But um {pause} the {disfmarker} the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape ,
Professor E : Oh , I see .
Postdoc F : But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet .
Professor E : Oh , I see .
Postdoc F : So they 're still working {disfmarker} some of them are {disfmarker} Two of them are still working on completing that . Yeah .
PhD B : Boy , they 're moving right along .
Professor E : Yeah .
Postdoc F : Yeah . They are . Mm - hmm . They 're very efficient . There 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others .
PhD B : Mm - hmm .
Professor E : Mm - hmm .
Postdoc F : Yeah .
Professor E : So what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what 's the deal with {disfmarker} with your {disfmarker}
PhD A : The channel u thing ?
Professor E : Yeah .
PhD A : Oh , it 's just uh , I ran the recognizer {disfmarker} uh , the {pause} {comment} speech - nonspeech detector on different channels and , it 's just in uh {disfmarker} in this new multi - channel format and output , and I just gave one {disfmarker} one meeting to {disfmarker} to Liz who wanted to {disfmarker} to try it for {disfmarker} for the recognizer
Professor E : Oh , I see .
PhD A : as uh , apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech , which took too much memory or whatever ,
Professor E : Right .
PhD A : and so {pause} she {disfmarker} she will try that I think
Professor E : Yeah .
PhD A : and {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm working on it . So , I hope {disfmarker}
Grad C : Is this anything different than the HMM system you were using before ?
Professor E : Yeah .
PhD A : No . Uh , I {pause} mmm , use some {disfmarker} some different features but not {disfmarker} not {disfmarker}
Grad C : Mm - hmm .
PhD A : The basic thing is this HMM base .
Grad C : So there 's still no {disfmarker} no knowledge using different channels at the same time .
PhD A : There is some , uh as the energy is normalized across channels
Grad C : You know what I mean ? Across all of them .
PhD A : yeah .
Grad C : OK .
PhD A : So . But basically that 's one of the main changes .
Grad C : Mm - hmm .
Professor E : Mm - hmm . What are some of the other features ? Besides the energy ? You said you 're trying some different features , or something .
PhD A : Oh I just uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mmm , I just use um our loudness - based things now as they {disfmarker} before there were {disfmarker} they were some in {disfmarker} in the log domain and I {disfmarker} I changed this to the {disfmarker} to the {disfmarker}
Professor E : Cu - Cube root ?
PhD A : Yeah . To {disfmarker} No , I changed this to the {disfmarker} to the {disfmarker} to the loudness thingy with the {disfmarker} with the
Grad C : Hmm .
Professor E : Ah .
PhD A : how do you call it ? I 'm not sure . With the , uh {disfmarker}
Professor E : Fletcher Munson ? No .
PhD A : I 'm not sure about the term .
Professor E : Oh , OK .
PhD A : Uh , I 'll look it up . And say it to you .
Professor E : Yeah , alright .
PhD A : Uh , OK , and {disfmarker} Yeah . That 's {disfmarker} that 's basically the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing . Yeah , and I {disfmarker} and I tried t to normalize uh {disfmarker} uh the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , um , within one channel ,
Professor E : OK .
PhD A : because they 're , {vocalsound} yeah to {disfmarker} to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech . And it works quite well . But , not always .
Professor E : Uh - huh . Uh - huh .
PhD A : So .
Professor E : OK .
Grad C : Good .
Professor E : Um , let 's see . I think the uh {disfmarker} Were {disfmarker} were you basically done with the transcription part ? So I guess the next thing is this uh {disfmarker} bleep editing .
Grad C : Right . So the {disfmarker} The idea is that we need to have {disfmarker} We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want . So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece {disfmarker} pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . And so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue . And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password ,
Professor E : Yeah .
Grad C : a single password . Each person will have a single password , user name and password . And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . And that way each person only has to remember one password .
Professor E : I {disfmarker} I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . I mean if people have {disfmarker} Uh , I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transc";yes;3;yes;3;yes;2;yes;2;yes;3;yes;1;yes;2
"PhD C : What channel am I on ?
PhD E : Channel .
PhD C : Oh , channel two .
PhD G : Make sure to turn your microphone on .
PhD E : Channel .
PhD G : There 's a battery .
Grad B : There we go .
PhD G : OK . Your channel number 's already on this blank sheet .
Grad B : Yeah .
PhD G : So you just {disfmarker} If you can {disfmarker}
Professor F : Channel five ? Channel five .
PhD E : Channel whatever .
Professor F : I 'm on channel five .
Grad B : Camera one , camera two .
PhD E : What am I ?
Professor F : Little low ?
PhD E : Channel four ?
Professor F : Channel five .
PhD E : This number four ? OK .
Professor F : Channel five . OK .
PhD G : The gai the gain 's up at it {disfmarker} what it usually is ,
Professor F : Is it ?
PhD G : but if you think it 's {disfmarker} Yeah . It 's sort of a default . But I can set it higher if you like .
Professor F : Oh . Maybe it should be a little higher .
PhD G : Yeah ?
Professor F : It 's not showing much . Test , test , test , test , test , test , test , test , test , test . OK , that {disfmarker} that seems better ? Yeah ? OK , good . Ah , that 's good , that 's good . That 's Ahh . Mmm . So I {disfmarker} I had a question for Adam . Have we started already ?
PhD G : Well , we started recording , but {disfmarker} Yeah .
Professor F : Yeah . Is Jane around or {disfmarker} ?
PhD D : I saw her earlier .
Professor F : Uh .
PhD D : I think {disfmarker}
PhD G : She can just walk in , I guess , or {disfmarker}
PhD D : Yeah . She 'll probably come up .
Professor F : Right .
PhD G : Since we 're starting late I figured we 'd better just start .
Professor F : Yeah . Great idea . I was gonna ask Adam to , uh , say if he thought anymore about the demo stuff because {vocalsound} it occurred to me that this is late May and the DARPA meeting is in {pause} mid July . Uh , but {vocalsound} I don't remember w what we {disfmarker} I know that we were gonna do something with the transcriber interface is one thing , but I thought there was a second thing . Anybody remember ?
PhD G : Well , we were gonna do a mock - up , like , question answering or something , I thought , that was totally separate from the interface . Do you remember ? Remember , like , asking questions and retrieving , {vocalsound} but in a pre - stored fashion .
Professor F : Mm - hmm . Right .
PhD G : That was the thing we talked about , I think , before the transcriber {disfmarker}
Professor F : Yeah .
PhD G : Come on in .
Professor F : Alright . So anyway , you have to sort out that out and get somebody going on it cuz we 're {disfmarker} got a {disfmarker} got a month left basically . So .
PhD G : You like these . Right ? OK , good .
Professor F : OK . Um OK . So , what are we g else we got ? You got {disfmarker} you just wrote a bunch of stuff .
PhD G : No . That was all , um , previously here .
Professor F : Oh .
PhD G : I was writing {pause} the digits and then I realized I could xerox them ,
Professor F : Oh , oh .
PhD G : because I didn't want people to turn their heads from these microphones . So . We all , by the way , have the same digit form , for the record . So .
Professor F : That 's cool .
PhD G : Yeah .
Professor F : So , the choice is , uh , which {disfmarker} which do we want more , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the comparison , uh , {vocalsound} of everybody saying them at the same time or the comparison of people saying the same digits at different times that {disfmarker} ?
PhD G : It 's just cuz I didn't have any more digit sheets .
Professor F : I know that . But , you know , which opportunity should we
PhD G : So . Yeah .
PhD C : Unison .
Professor F : exploit ? {vocalsound} Unison .
PhD G : I mean , it {disfmarker} Actually it might be good to have them separately and have the same exact strings . I mean , we could use them for normalizing or something , but it of course goes more quickly doing them in unison .
Professor F : I guess we 'll see
PhD G : I don't know .
Professor F : i I guess it 's dependent on
PhD G : See how long we go .
Professor F : how long we go and how good the snack is out there .
PhD E : But anyway , they won't be identical as somebody is saying zero in some {disfmarker} sometimes , you know , saying O , and so , it 's not i not identical .
Professor F : Yeah . Hmm . Get some advance intelligence .
PhD G : Right . Right .
Professor F : Yeah . We 'd have to train .
PhD G : We 'd be like a chorus .
PhD E : OK .
Professor F : Yeah . We 'd have to get s get some experience .
PhD C : Greek chorus .
Grad B : Yeah .
PhD G : Yes .
Professor F : Yeah . Really {pause} boring chorus . Um . Do we {pause} have an agenda ? Adam usually tries to put those together , but he 's ill .
PhD D : I 've got a couple of things to talk about .
Professor F : So . Yeah . Uh ju what {disfmarker} what might those be ?
PhD D : Uh , IBM stuff and , um , just getting {vocalsound} uh , meeting information organized .
Professor F : Meeting info organized . OK . Um .
PhD C : Are you implying that it 's currently disorganized ?
PhD D : In my mind .
Professor F : Is there stuff that 's happened about , um , uh , the {pause} SRI recognizer et cetera , tho those things that were happening before with {disfmarker} ?
PhD C : Well .
Professor F : Y y you guys were doing a bunch of experiments with different front - ends and then with {disfmarker} Is {disfmarker} is that still sort of where it was , uh , the other day ?
PhD C : We 're improving .
Professor F : We 're improving .
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD D : Now the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} You saw the note that the PLP now is getting basically the same as the MFCC .
Professor F : Right .
PhD D : Right ?
PhD C : Yeah . Actually it looks like it 's getting better .
Professor F : Right . Oh .
PhD C : So . But {disfmarker} but it 's not {disfmarker}
Professor F : Just with {disfmarker} with age , kind of .
PhD C : With age . Yeah .
Professor F : Yeah . Yeah .
PhD C : But , uh , that 's not d directly related to me . Doesn't mean we can't talk about it . Um , it seems {disfmarker} It looks l I haven't {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} The experiment is still not complete , but , um , it looks like the vocal tract length normalization is working beautifully , actually , w using the warp factors that we computed for the SRI system and just applying them to the {vocalsound} ICSI front - end .
Professor F : Mm - hmm . That 's pretty funny .
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor F : OK .
PhD G : So you just need to {pause} copy over to this one .
PhD C : Just had to take the reciprocal of the number because they have different meanings in the two systems .
Postdoc A : OK .
Professor F : Ah ! Yeah . Well , that 's always good to do .
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor F : OK . OK . Uh {disfmarker}
PhD C : But one issue actually that just came up in discussion with Liz and {disfmarker} and Don was , um , as far as meeting recognition is concerned , um , we would really like to , uh , move , uh , to , uh , doing the recognition on automatic segmentations .
Professor F : Yeah .
PhD C : Because in all our previous experiments , we had the {disfmarker} uh , you know , we were essentially cheating by having the , um , you know , the h the hand - segmentations as the basis of the recognition .
Professor F : Mm - hmm .
PhD C : And so now with Thilo 's segmenter working so well , I think we should {pause} consider doing a {disfmarker}
PhD E : Mmm . So .
Grad B : Come on .
PhD C : uh , doing {disfmarker}
PhD E : Yeah . We {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}
Professor F : Y think {disfmarker} you think we should increase the error rate .
PhD E : Anyway . Yeah .
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD E : Yeah .
Professor F : Good .
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor F : Yeah .
PhD E : That - that 's what I wanted to do anyway ,
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD E : so we should just get together and {disfmarker}
PhD G : Yeah .
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD G : And even {disfmarker} The good thing is that since you , um , have high recall , {comment} even if you have low precision cuz you 're over - generating , that 's good because we could train noise models in the recognizer for these kinds of , uh , transients and things that come from the microphones ,
PhD C : Right .
PhD E : Yeah . Yeah .
PhD G : but {vocalsound} I know that if we run recognition unconstrained on a whole waveform , we do very poorly because we 're {disfmarker} we 're getting insertions in places what {disfmarker} that you may well be cutting out .
PhD C : Well {disfmarker}
PhD E : Yeah .
Professor F : Mm - hmm .
PhD G : So we do need some kind of pre - segmentation .
PhD C : We should {disfmarker} we should consider doing some extra things , like , um , you know , retraining or adapting the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the models for background noise to the {disfmarker} to this environment , for instance .
PhD G : Mmm . Yeah .
PhD E : Yeah .
PhD G : And , yeah , using Thilo 's , you know , posteriors or some kind of {disfmarker} or {disfmarker}
PhD C : So .
PhD G : right now they 're {disfmarker} they 're discrete ,
PhD E : Yeah .
PhD G : yes or no for a speaker , to consider those particular speaker background models .
PhD C : Right .
PhD G : So . There 's lots of ins interesting things that could be done .
PhD E : Yeah . Yeah . We should do that .
PhD G : So .
Professor F : Good . So , uh , why don't we , uh , do the IBM stuff ?
PhD D : Yeah . So , um , talked with Brian and gave him the alternatives to the single beep at the end of each utterance that we had generated before .
Professor F : You had some {pause} thing about that ? Right .
PhD D : And so {disfmarker}
Professor F : The , uh , Chuck chunks .
PhD D : Yeah . The Chuck chunks .
PhD E : Hmm .
PhD D : Right . And so he talked it over with the transcriber and the transcriber thought that the easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then the nu a number , a digit , and then a beep , uh , at the beginning of each one
Professor F : Yeah . Yeah .
PhD D : and that would help keep them from getting lost . And , um , {vocalsound} so Adam wrote a little script to generate those style , uh , beeps
PhD C : Where 'd you get the digits from ?
PhD D : and so we 're {disfmarker} I came up here and just recorded the numbers one through ten .
Postdoc A : They sound really good .
PhD D : So . Does it sound OK ?
PhD G : That 's a great idea .
Postdoc A : Yeah .
PhD D : So , um {disfmarker} Yeah . We just used those .
PhD C : And do you splice them into the {pause} waveform ? Or {disfmarker} ?
PhD D : Yeah . He {disfmarker} then he d I recorded {disfmarker} Actually , I recorded one through ten three times at three different speeds and then he picked .
PhD C : Right . Mm - hmm .
PhD D : He liked the fastest one , so he just cut those out {vocalsound} and spliced them in between , uh , two beeps .
Postdoc A : It sounds like a radio announcer 's voice . Really .
PhD E : It will be funny uh {disfmarker}
Postdoc A : Yeah , yeah .
PhD D : Does it ?
PhD E : It will be funny when you 're really reading digits , and then there are the chunks with {disfmarker} with your {pause} digits in ?
PhD D : Yeah . With my {disfmarker}
Postdoc A : Oh that 's right .
PhD G : Oh , right .
PhD E : Yeah .
Postdoc A : Now actually ,
PhD D : That 'll throw them ,
Postdoc A : we 're {disfmarker} Are we handling {disfmarker} ?
PhD D : huh ?
Professor F : Uh , maybe we should have you record A , B , C for those or something .
PhD D : Yeah . {comment} Huh ! Maybe . And she said it wasn't gonna {disfmarker} the transcriber said it wouldn't be a problem cuz they can actually make a template , uh , that has beep , number , beep . So for them it 'll be very quick
PhD E : OK .
PhD D : to {disfmarker} to put those in there {vocalsound} when they 're transcribing .
Professor F : Yeah .
PhD D : So , um , we {disfmarker} We 're gonna send them one more sample meeting , uh , and Thilo has run his segmentation . Adam 's gonna generate the chunked file . And then , um , I 'll give it to Brian and they can try that out . And when we get that back we 'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with , uh , too many beeps in the last transcription .
Professor F : OK . Do w do {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} Do you have any idea of the turn - around on {disfmarker} on those steps you just said ?
PhD G : Great .
PhD D : Uh . Our s our {disfmarker} On our side ?
Professor F : Uh .
PhD D : or including IBM 's ?
Professor F : Including IBM 's .
PhD D : Well , I don't know . The last one seemed like it took a couple of weeks . Um , maybe even three .
Professor F : OK .
PhD D : Uh , that 's just the I B M side . Our side is quick . I mean , I {disfmarker} I don't know . How long does your {disfmarker} ?
PhD E : It should @ @ be finished today or something . Yeah .
Professor F : Well , I meant the overall thing .
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor F : e e u u {comment} The reason I 'm asking is because , uh , Jane and I have just been talking , and she 's just been doing . {vocalsound} Uh , e a , you know , further hiring of transcribers .
PhD D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Professor F : And so we don't sort of really know exactly what they 'll be doing , how long they 'll be doing it , and so forth , because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working .
PhD D : Right .
Professor F : And , uh , so it 'd be {disfmarker} It 'd be good to sort of get that resolved , uh , soon as we could ,
PhD D : Yeah . I {disfmarker} Yeah , I {disfmarker} I hope @ @ {comment} we can get a better estimate from this {pause} one that we send them .
Professor F : and then {disfmarker}
PhD D : So . Um .
Professor F : Mm - hmm .
PhD D : I {disfmarker} I don't know yet how long that 'll take .
Professor F : Yeah . Um {disfmarker} I mean in particular I would {disfmarker} I would really hope that when we do this DARPA meeting in July that we sort of have {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're into production mode , somehow {disfmarker}
PhD D : Mm - hmm .
Professor F : You know , that we {disfmarker} we actually {vocalsound} have a stream going and we know how {disfmarker} how well it does and how {disfmarker} and how it operates .
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor F : I think that would {disfmarker} that would certainly be a {disfmarker} a very good thing to know .
PhD D : Right . Right .
Professor F : OK . Uh . Maybe before we do the meeting info organize thing , maybe you could say relevant stuff about where we are in transcriptions .
Postdoc A : OK . So , um , we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , the transcribers have continued to work past what I 'm calling "" set one "" , which was the s the set that I 've been , uh {disfmarker} OK , talking about up to this point , but , uh , they 've gotten five meetings done in that set . Right now they 're in the process of being edited . Um , the , um {disfmarker} Let 's see , I hired two transcribers today . I 'm thinking of hiring another one , which will {disfmarker} because we 've had a lot of attrition . And that will bring our total to {disfmarker}
Professor F : They die off after they do this for a while .
Postdoc A : Yeah . Well , you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's various things .
PhD D : Burn - out .
Professor F : Yeah .
Postdoc A : So , one of them had a baby . Um , you know , one of them really w wasn't planning {disfmarker}
PhD C : Oh , that was an unfor unforeseen side effect of {disfmarker}
Postdoc A : Eh , one of them , um , had never planned to work past January . I mean , it 's th all these various things , cuz we , you know , we presented it as possibly a month project back in January and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} Um , so it makes sense . Uh , through attrition we {disfmarker} we 've {disfmarker} we 're down to {disfmarker} to two , but they 're really solid . We 're really lucky the two that we kept . And , um {disfmarker} Well , I don't mean {disfmarker} I don't mean anything against the others . {comment} What I mean is we 've got a good cause {disfmarker} a good core . No . We had a good core {disfmarker}
PhD G : Well , they won't hear this since they 're going . They won't be transcribing this meeting .
Postdoc A : Yeah , but still . I mean , I d it 's just a matter of we {disfmarker} w we 're {disfmarker} we 've got , uh ,
Professor F : No backs .
Postdoc A : two of the ones who {disfmarker} who , um , ha had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they 're continuing to put in a {disfmarker} a lot of hours , which is wonderful , and excellent work . And so , then , in addition , um , I hired two more today and I 'm planning to h hire a third one with this {disfmarker} within this coming week , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but the plan is {disfmarker} just as , uh , Morgan was saying we discussed this , and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the {disfmarker} on the leaner side , you know , rather than hiring , like , eight to ten right now ,
Professor F : Mm - hmm .
Postdoc A : because if the IBM thing comes through really quickly , then , um , we wouldn't wanna have to , uh , you know , lay people off and stuff . So . And this way it 'll {disfmarker} I mean , I got really a lot of response for {disfmarker} for my notice and I think I could hire additional people if I {pause} wish to .
Professor F : Yeah . An - and the other thing is , I mean , in the unlikely event {disfmarker} and since we 're so far from this , it 's a little hard to plan this way {disfmarker} in the unlikely event that we actually find {vocalsound} that we have , uh , transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs because , you know , there 's , you know , {vocalsound} all the stuff that {disfmarker} that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're {disfmarker} and they 're faster {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pipeline is faster than {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , than the generation , um , eh , i in {disfmarker} in the day {disfmarker} e event that that day actually dawns , uh , I {disfmarker} I bet we could find some other stuff for them to do .
Postdoc A : Oh , yes .
Professor F : So I {disfmarker} I think {vocalsound} that , eh , eh , a as we were talking , if we {disfmarker} if we hire twelve , then we could , you know , run into a problem later . I mean , we also just couldn't sustain that forever . But {disfmarker} but , um {disfmarker} for all sorts of reasons {disfmarker} but if we hire f you know , f we have five on staff {disfmarker} five or six on staff at any given time , then {vocalsound} it 's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way .
Postdoc A : Good . OK .
Professor F : Good .
PhD G : It 'd be great , too , if , um , we can {disfmarker} we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries or some hand {disfmarker} to experiment with , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , to have a ground truth for this segmentation work , which {disfmarker} I guess you have some already that was really helpful , and we could probably use more .
PhD E : Mmm , yeah . That was a thing I {disfmarker} I planned working on , is , uh , to use the {disfmarker} the transcriptions which are done by now , and to {disfmarker} to use them as , uh {disfmarker}
PhD G : Oh . Oh , the new ones
PhD E : Yeah .
PhD G : with the tighter boundaries . Yeah .
PhD E : Yeah . And to use them for {disfmarker} for training a {disfmarker} or for {disfmarker} fo whatever . Yeah . To {disfmarker} to create some speech - nonspeech labels out of them , and {disfmarker} Yeah , but that {disfmarker} that 's a thing w was {disfmarker} w what I 'm just looking into .
PhD G : OK .
Postdoc A : The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pre - segmentations are so much {disfmarker} are s so extremely helpful . Now there was , uh , I g guess {disfmarker} So , a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation {disfmarker} f for just very few days you were away . But it happened to be during that time I needed one ,
PhD E : Yeah .
Postdoc A : so I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so I started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours and , um , they , um {disfmarker} you know , they always appreciate that when they have that available . And he 's , uh , usually , eh , uh , um {disfmarker} Um . So they really appreciate it . But I was gonna say that they do adjust it once in a while . You know , once in a while there 's something like ,
PhD E : Yeah , sure .
Postdoc A : um , and e Actually you talked to them . Didn't you ? Did you ? Have you {disfmarker} ?
PhD E : Yeah . I talked to Helen .
Postdoc A : And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and she was {disfmarker} And so , I asked her {disfmarker} I mean , They 're very perceptive . I really want to have this meeting of the transcribers . I haven't done it yet , but I wanna do that and she 's out of town , um , for a couple of weeks , but I wanna do that when she returns . Um , cuz she was saying , you know , in a {disfmarker} in a span of very short period {disfmarker} we asked {disfmarker} It seems like the ones that need to be adjusted are these {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these things , and she was saying the short utterances , uh , the , um {disfmarker}
PhD G : Hmm .
PhD E : Mmm . Yeah .
Postdoc A : you know , I mean , you 're {disfmarker} You 're aware of this . But {disfmarker} but actually i it 's so correct for so much of the time , that it 's an enormous time saver
PhD E : Yeah .
Postdoc A : and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries . So .
PhD G : That 's great .
Postdoc A : Um . Yeah . I think it 'd be interesting to combine these .
PhD E : Yeah .
PhD G : Is there actually a record of where they change ? I mean , you can compare , do a diff on the {disfmarker} just so that we {vocalsound} knew {disfmarker}
Postdoc A : You could do it . It 's {disfmarker} it 's complicated in that {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} hhh , i hhh , i
PhD E : Yeah . Actually , when {disfmarker} when they create new {disfmarker} yeah , new segments or something , it will be , uh , not that easy but {disfmarker} hmm . I think {pause} one could do that .
PhD G : I mean , if we keep a old copy of the old time marks
PhD E : Yeah .
PhD G : just so that if we run it we know whether we 're {disfmarker} which ones were cheating
PhD E : Yeah . Yeah . That would be great , yeah , to know that .
PhD G : and
Postdoc A : There is a {disfmarker} there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what I do is I merge what they 've done with the pre - segmented version .
PhD G : which one would be good .
PhD E : Yeah .
Postdoc A : So it 's not a pure {disfmarker} it 's not a pure condition . Wha - what you 'd really like is that they started with pre - segmented and were pre - segmented all the way through .
PhD G : Mm - hmm .
Postdoc A : And , um {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} {disfmarker} I , uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} it wasn't possible for about four of the recent ones . But , it will be possible in the future
PhD E : Yeah .
Postdoc A : because we {disfmarker} we 're , um .
PhD E : It would .
PhD G : Mmm , that 's great .
PhD E : Yeah .
PhD G : Yeah . As long as we have a record , I guess , of the original {pause} automatic one , we can always find out how well {pause} we would do fr from the recognition side by using those boundaries .
PhD E : Yeah . Yeah .
PhD G : Um .
PhD E : Yeah .
PhD G : You know , a completely non - cheating version .
PhD E : Yeah .
PhD G : Also if you need someone to record this meeting , I mean , I 'm happy to {disfmarker} for the transcribers {disfmarker} I could do it , or Chuck or Adam .
Postdoc A : Thank you .
Professor F : OK . So , uh , u you were saying something about organizing the meeting info ?
PhD D : Yeah . So , um , uh , Jane and Adam and I had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the {pause} directory structure for all of the meeting {disfmarker}
Professor F : Did you record it ?
PhD D : No . For all the Meeting Recorder data . We should have . Um . And so we 've got a plan for what we 're gonna do there . And then , Jane also s prepared a {disfmarker} um , started getting all of the {disfmarker} the meetings organized , so she prepared a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a spreadsheet , which I spent the last couple of days adding to . So I went through all of the data that we have collected so far , and have been putting it into , uh , a spreadsheet {vocalsound} with start time , the date , the old meeting name , the new meeting name , the number of speakers , the duration of the meeting , comments , you know , what its transcription status is , all that kind of stuff . And so , the idea is that we can take this and then export it as HTML and put it on the Meeting Recorder web page so we can keep people updated about what 's going on .
PhD G : Oh , great .
PhD D : Um , I 've gotta get some more information from Jane cuz I have some {disfmarker} some gaps here that I need to get her to fill in , but {vocalsound} so far , um , {vocalsound} as of Monday , the fourteenth , um , we 've had a total number of meeting sixty - two hours of meetings that we have collected . And , um {disfmarker} Uh , some other interesting things , average number of speakers per meeting is six . Um , and I 'm gonna have on here the total amount that 's been transcribed so far , but I 've got a bunch of {disfmarker} uh , that 's what I have to talk to Jane about , figuring out exactly which ones have {disfmarker} have been completed and so forth . But , um , {vocalsound} this 'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the {disfmarker} the web site and people can {vocalsound} be informed of the status of various different ones . And {vocalsound} it 'll also list , uh , like under the status , if it 's at IBM or if it 's at ICSI , uh , or if it 's completed or which ones we 're excluding and {disfmarker} and there 's a place for comments , so we can , {vocalsound} um , say why we 're excluding things and so forth . So .
Professor F : Now would the ones that , um , are already transcribed {disfmarker} we h we have enough there that c you know , we 've already done some studies and so forth and {disfmarker} um , shouldn't we go through and do the business - es u of {disfmarker} of having the , um , uh , participants approve it , uh , for {disfmarker} approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth ?
Postdoc A : Um , interesting idea . In principle , I {disfmarker} I would say yes , although I still am doing some {disfmarker} the final - pass editing , trying to convert it over to the master file as the {disfmarker} being the channelized version and it 's {disfmarker} Yeah , it seems like I get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes {comment} and I have to stop . Cleaning up the things like the , uh , uh , places where the transcriber was uncertain , and {disfmarker} and doing spot - checking here and there . So , um , uh , I guess it would make sense to wait until th that 's done , um , but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker}
Professor F : Well , le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} as I did with the , uh , uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pipeline .
Postdoc A : Yeah .
Professor F : Um , we are gonna have this DARPA {pause} meeting in the middle of July ,
Postdoc A : Yes .
Professor F : and I think it w it 'd be {disfmarker} given that we 've been {disfmarker} we 've given a couple public talks about it already , spaced by months and months , I think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available . Um .
Postdoc A : It 'll certainly be done by then . Yeah .
Professor F : Right . So we can s we {disfmarker} we wanna be able to say "" here is a subset that is available right now ""
Postdoc A : Mm - hmm . That 's right .
Professor F : and that 's has been through the legal issues and so forth .
Postdoc A : That 's right .
Professor F : So .
Postdoc A : Yeah . That 's right . So that {disfmarker}
Professor F : OK ?
Postdoc A : OK .
Professor F : So , by {disfmarker} before July .
PhD C : And they don't have to approve , you know , th an edited version , they can just give their approval to whatever version
Postdoc A : Well , maybe {disfmarker}
Professor F : Well , in principle , yes . But , I mean , i if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then we
PhD C : Bu Yeah . But th I mean , the editing will continue . Presumably if {disfmarker} if s errors are found , they will be fixed , but they won't change the {disfmarker} the content of the meetings .
PhD D : Content , really .
Postdoc A : Well , see , this is the {disfmarker} this is the issue . Subtleties .
PhD C : So .
PhD G : Well , i if Jane is clarifying question question , then , you know , how can they agree to it before they know her final version ?
Postdoc A : The other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @ {comment} could 've been transcribed in the other way .
Professor F : Yeah .
PhD G : Thing {disfmarker}
Postdoc A : And no and they wouldn't have {vocalsound} been slanderous if it had been this other word . You know ?
Professor F : I it {disfmarker} you know , there there is a point at which I agree it becomes ridiculous because , you know , you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say , you know , that should be a period and not a question mark . Right ? And you don't {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} there 's no way that we 're gonna go back and ask everybody "" do you approve this , uh , you know {disfmarker} this document now ? "" So {disfmarker} So I think what it is is that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing that they sign {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I haven't looked at it in a while , but it has to be open enough that it sort of says "" OK , from now on {disfmarker} you know , now that I 've read this , you can use {disfmarker} do anything you want with these data . ""
Postdoc A : Mm - hmm .
Professor F : And , uh {disfmarker} But , i I think we wanna {disfmarker} So , assuming that it 's in that kind of wording , which I don't remember , {vocalsound} um , I think i we just wanna have enough confidence ourselves that it 's so close to the final form it 's gonna be in , a year from now that they 're {disfmarker}
Postdoc A : Mm - hmm . I agree . Mmm . I totally agree . It 's just , uh , a question of , {vocalsound} uh , if {disfmarker} if the person is using the transcript as the way of them judging what they said and whether it was slanderous , {vocalsound} then it seems like it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} i it needs to be more correct than if we could count on them re - listening to the meeting .
Professor F : Uh .
Postdoc A : Because it becomes , eh , in a way a {disfmarker} a f uh , a legal document i if they 've agreed to that .
Professor F : Well , I forget how we end Right . I forget how we ended up on this , but I remember my taking the position {vocalsound} of not making it so {disfmarker} so easy for everybody to observe everything and Adam was taking the position of {disfmarker} of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio . And I don't remember who won , Adam or me , but {disfmarker}
Postdoc A : Well , {vocalsound} if it 's only the transcript , though {disfmarker} I mean , th this {disfmarker} this is my point , that {disfmarker} that
Professor F : uh , the {disfmarker} Uh , that that 's why I 'm bringing this up again , because I can't remember how we ended up .
Postdoc A : then it becomes {disfmarker}
Professor F : That it was the transcrip He wanted to do a web interface that would make it {disfmarker}
Postdoc A : Well , if it 's just the audio {disfmarker} Well .
Professor F : that would give you access to the transcript and the audio . That 's what Adam wanted .
Postdoc A : Mm - hmm .
Professor F : And I don't remember how we ended up .
PhD G : I mean , with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes , or something like that . And , I mean , I would say "" no "" . Like , I don't wanna know , but some people might be really {vocalsound} interested and then y In other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that .
Professor F : You decided you were whispering Satanic incantations under your breath when you were {disfmarker}
PhD G : Well , {vocalsound} I don't know what happened to the small heads thing , but I j {vocalsound} Um , I 'm just saying that , like , you know , you can sort of say that any things that are deemed {disfmarker";yes;3;yes;3;yes;2;yes;1;yes;2;yes;2;yes;2
"Professor B : OK .
PhD C : Oh , I don't {disfmarker}
PhD A : I think I 'm zero .
Professor B : Wow ! Unprecedented .
PhD C : Hello , hello , hello , hello .
PhD E : Ah
Grad F : Wh - what causes the crash ?
PhD A : Did you fix something ?
PhD C : Hello .
PhD E : Five , five .
PhD C : Hello , hello .
Grad F : Oh , maybe it 's the turning {disfmarker} turning off and turning on of the mike , right ?
Professor B : Uh , you think that 's you ? Oh .
PhD C : Aaa - aaa - aaa .
Grad F : Yeah , OK , mine 's working .
PhD C : OK . That 's me .
Professor B : OK . OK . So , um I guess we are {pause} um {pause} gonna do the digits at the end . Uh
PhD D : Channel {disfmarker} channel three , yeah .
PhD C : Channel two .
PhD D : OK .
PhD E : Mmm , channel five ? Doesn't work ?
Professor B : Yeah , that 's the mike number there , uh {pause} Uh , mike number five , and {pause} channel {disfmarker} channel four .
PhD C : Two .
PhD A : Is it written on her sheet , I believe .
PhD E : No ? Ah ,
PhD D : Mike four .
Grad F : Watch this .
PhD E : era el cuatro .
Grad F : Yep , that 's me .
PhD E : Yeah .
PhD A : But , channel
PhD E : Yeah yeah yeah .
Professor B : This is you .
PhD E : OK . I saw that . Ah {disfmarker} yeah , it 's OK .
Professor B : Yeah . And I 'm channel uh two I think ,
PhD C : Ooo .
Professor B : or channel {disfmarker}
PhD C : I think I 'm channel two .
Professor B : Oh , I 'm channel {disfmarker} must be channel one . Channel one ?
PhD E : Channel {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I decided to talk about that .
Professor B : Yes , OK . OK . So uh {pause} I also copied uh the results that we all got in the mail I think from uh {disfmarker} {pause} from OGI and we 'll go {disfmarker} go through them also . So where are we on {disfmarker} {pause} on uh {vocalsound} {pause} our runs ?
PhD D : Uh so . {pause} uh {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} So {pause} As I was already said , we {disfmarker} we mainly focused on uh four kind of features .
Professor B : Excuse me .
PhD D : The PLP , the PLP with JRASTA , the MSG , and the MFCC from the baseline Aurora .
Professor B : Mm - hmm .
PhD D : Uh , and we focused for the {disfmarker} the test part on the English and the Italian . Um . We 've trained uh several neural networks on {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} on the TI - digits English {pause} and on the Italian data and also on the broad uh {pause} English uh French and uh Spanish databases . Mmm , so there 's our result tables here , for the tandem approach , and um , actually what we {disfmarker} we @ @ observed is that if the network is trained on the task data it works pretty well .
Professor B : OK . Our {disfmarker} our uh {disfmarker} {pause} There 's a {disfmarker} {pause} We 're pausing for a photo {disfmarker}
PhD C : Chicken on the grill . Try that corner .
PhD A : How about over th from the front of the room ?
PhD C : Yeah , it 's longer .
Professor B : We 're pausing for a photo opportunity here . Uh . {vocalsound} Uh . So .
Grad F : Oh wait wait wait wait wait . Wait .
PhD C : Get out of the {disfmarker} Yeah .
Grad F : Hold on . Hold on .
Professor B : OK .
Grad F : Let me give you a black screen .
Professor B : He 's facing this way . What ? OK , this {disfmarker} this would be a {pause} good section for our silence detection .
Grad F : OK .
PhD C : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : Um Oh .
Grad F : Musical chairs everybody !
Professor B : OK . So um , {pause} you were saying {pause} about the training data {disfmarker} Yeah .
PhD D : Yeah , so if the network is trained on the task data um {pause} tandem works pretty well . And uh actually we have uh , results are similar Only on ,
PhD A : Do you mean if it 's trained only on {disfmarker} On data from just that task ,
PhD D : yeah .
PhD A : that language ?
PhD D : Just that task . But actually we didn't train network on {pause} uh both types of data I mean {pause} uh {pause} phonetically ba phonetically balanced uh data and task data .
PhD A : Mmm .
PhD D : We only did either task {disfmarker} task data or {pause} uh broad {pause} data .
PhD A : Mm - hmm .
PhD D : Um {pause} Yeah . So ,
Professor B : So how {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} clearly it 's gonna be good then
PhD A : So what 's th
Professor B : but the question is how much {pause} worse is it {pause} if you have broad data ? I mean , {pause} my assump From what I saw from the earlier results , uh I guess last week , {pause} was that um , {pause} if you {pause} trained on one language and tested on another , say , that {pause} the results were {disfmarker} were relatively poor .
PhD D : Mmm . Yeah .
Professor B : But {disfmarker} but the question is if you train on one language {pause} but you have a broad coverage {pause} and then test in another , {pause} does that {disfmarker} {pause} is that improve things {pause} i c in comparison ?
PhD D : If we use the same language ?
Professor B : No , no , no . Different lang So {pause} um {pause} If you train on TI - digits {pause} and test on Italian digits , {pause} you do poorly , {pause} let 's say .
PhD D : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : I don't have the numbers in front of me ,
PhD D : But {disfmarker} Yeah but I did not uh do that .
Professor B : so I 'm just imagining . E So , you didn't train on {pause} TIMIT and test on {disfmarker} {pause} on Italian digits , say ?
PhD D : We {disfmarker} No , we did four {disfmarker} four kind of {disfmarker} of testing , actually . The first testing is {pause} with task data {disfmarker} So , with nets trained on task data . So for Italian on the Italian speech @ @ . The second test is trained on a single language um with broad database , but the same language as the t task data .
Professor B : OK .
PhD D : But for Italian we choose Spanish which {pause} we assume is close to Italian . The third test is by using , um the three language database
Professor B : W which in {disfmarker}
PhD D : and the fourth is
Professor B : It has three languages . That 's including the w the {disfmarker} {pause} the {disfmarker}
PhD D : This includes {disfmarker}
Professor B : the one that it 's {disfmarker}
PhD D : Yeah .
PhD A : In
PhD D : But {pause} not digits . I mean it 's {disfmarker}
PhD A : The three languages {pause} is not digits ,
Professor B : Right .
PhD A : it 's the broad {pause} data . OK .
PhD D : Yeah And the fourth test is uh {pause} excluding from these three languages the language {pause} that is {pause} the task language .
Professor B : Oh , OK , yeah , so , that is what I wanted to know .
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : I just wasn't saying it very well , I guess .
PhD D : Uh , yeah . So um {pause} for uh TI - digits for ins example {pause} uh when we go from TI - digits training to {pause} TIMIT training {pause} uh we lose {pause} uh around ten percent , uh . The error rate increase u of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of ten percent , relative .
Professor B : Relative . Right .
PhD D : So this is not so bad . And then when we jump to the multilingual data it 's uh it become worse and , well Around uh , let 's say , {pause} twenty perc twenty percent further .
Professor B : Ab - about how much ?
PhD D : So . Yeah .
Professor B : Twenty percent further ?
PhD D : Twenty to {disfmarker} to thirty percent further . Yeah .
PhD A : And so , remind me , the multilingual stuff is just the broad data . Right ? It 's not the digits .
PhD D : Yeah .
PhD A : So it 's the combination of {pause} two things there . It 's {pause} removing the {pause} task specific {pause} training and {pause} it 's adding other languages .
PhD D : Yeah . Yeah .
PhD A : OK .
PhD D : But the first step is al already removing the task s specific from {disfmarker} from {disfmarker}
PhD A : Already , right right right .
PhD D : So .
PhD A : So they were sort of building {pause} here ?
PhD D : And we lose {disfmarker}
PhD A : OK ?
PhD D : Yeah . Uh {pause} So , basically when it 's trained on the {disfmarker} the multilingual broad data {pause} um or number {disfmarker} so , the {disfmarker} the {pause} ratio of our error rates uh with the {pause} baseline error rate is around {pause} uh one point one .
Professor B : Yes . {vocalsound} And it 's something like one point three of {disfmarker} of the {pause} uh {disfmarker}
PhD D : So .
Professor B : I i if you compare everything to the first case at the baseline , you get something like one point one for the {disfmarker} for the using the same language but a different task , and something like one point three {pause} for three {disfmarker} three languages {pause} broad stuff .
PhD D : No no no . Uh same language we are at uh {disfmarker} for at English at O point eight . So it improves , {pause} compared to the baseline . But {disfmarker} So . Le - let me .
Professor B : I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm sorry .
PhD D : Tas - task data
Professor B : I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I meant something different by baseline
PhD D : we are u Yeah .
Professor B : So let me {disfmarker} let me {disfmarker} Um , {pause} so , {pause} um {disfmarker}
PhD D : Mmm .
Professor B : OK , fine . Let 's {disfmarker} let 's use the conventional meaning of baseline .
PhD D : Hmm .
Professor B : I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} By baseline here I meant {pause} uh using the task specific data .
PhD D : Oh yeah , the f Yeah , OK .
Professor B : But uh {disfmarker} {pause} uh , because that 's what you were just doing with this ten percent .
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : So I was just {disfmarker} I just trying to understand that .
PhD D : Yeah . Sure .
Professor B : So if we call {pause} a factor of w just one , just normalized to one , the word error rate {pause} that you have {pause} for using TI - digits as {disfmarker} as {pause} training and TI - digits as test ,
PhD D : Mmm .
Professor B : uh different words , I 'm sure ,
PhD D : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : but {disfmarker} {pause} but uh , uh the same {pause} task and so on .
PhD D : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : If we call that "" one "" , {pause} then what you 're saying is {pause} that the word error rate {pause} for the same language but using {pause} uh different training data than you 're testing on , say TIMIT and so forth , {pause} it 's one point one .
PhD D : Mm - hmm . Yeah , it 's around one point one .
Professor B : Right . And if it 's {disfmarker}
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : you {pause} do {pause} go to {pause} three languages including the English , {pause} it 's something like one point three . That 's what you were just saying , I think .
PhD D : Ye Uh , more actually .
PhD A : One point four ?
PhD D : If I {disfmarker} Yeah .
PhD A : So , it 's an additional thirty percent .
PhD D : What would you say ? Around one point four
Professor B : OK .
PhD D : yeah .
Professor B : And if you exclude {pause} English , {pause} from this combination , what 's that ?
PhD D : If we exclude English , {pause} um {pause} there is {pause} not much difference with the {pause} data with English .
Professor B : Aha !
PhD D : So . Yeah .
Professor B : That 's interesting . {pause} That 's interesting . Do you see ? Because {disfmarker} Uh ,
PhD D : Uh .
Professor B : so {disfmarker} No , that {disfmarker} that 's important . So what {disfmarker} what it 's saying here is just that "" yes , there is a reduction {pause} in performance , {pause} when you don't {pause} um {pause} have the s {pause} when you don't have {pause} um
PhD A : Task data .
Professor B : Wait a minute , th th the {disfmarker}
PhD D : Hmm .
Professor B : No , actually {pause} it 's interesting . So it 's {disfmarker} So when you go to a different task , there 's actually not so {pause} different . It 's when you went to these {disfmarker} So what 's the difference between two and three ? Between the one point one case and the one point four case ? I 'm confused .
PhD A : It 's multilingual .
PhD D : Yeah . The only difference it 's {disfmarker} is that it 's multilingual {disfmarker} Um
Professor B : Cuz in both {disfmarker} in both {disfmarker} both of those cases , you don't have the same task .
PhD D : Yeah . Yeah sure .
Professor B : So is {disfmarker} is the training data for the {disfmarker} for this one point four case {disfmarker} does it include the training data for the one point one case ?
PhD D : Uh yeah .
Grad F : Yeah , a fraction of it .
PhD D : A part of it , yeah .
Professor B : How m how much bigger is it ?
PhD D : Um {pause} It 's two times ,
Grad F : Yeah , um .
PhD D : actually ? Yeah . Um . The English data {disfmarker} {pause} No , the multilingual databases are two times the {pause} broad English {pause} data . We just wanted to keep this , w well , not too huge . So .
Professor B : So it 's two times , but it includes the {disfmarker} but it includes the broad English data .
PhD D : I think so . Do you {disfmarker} Uh , Yeah .
Professor B : And the broad English data is what you got this one point one {pause} with . So that 's TIMIT basically right ?
PhD D : Yeah .
Grad F : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : So it 's band - limited TIMIT . This is all eight kilohertz sampling .
PhD D : Mm - hmm .
Grad F : Mm - hmm .
PhD D : Yeah .
Grad F : Downs Right .
Professor B : So you have band - limited TIMIT , {pause} gave you uh almost as good as a result as using TI - digits {pause} on a TI - digits test . OK ?
PhD D : Hmm ?
Professor B : Um {pause} and {pause} um But , {pause} when you add in more training data but keep the neural net the same size , {pause} it {pause} um performs worse on the TI - digits . OK , now all of this is {disfmarker} {pause} This is noisy {pause} TI - digits , I assume ? Both training and test ?
PhD D : 
Professor B : Yeah . OK . Um OK . Well . {pause} We {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we may just need to uh {disfmarker} So I mean it 's interesting that h going to a different {disfmarker} different task didn't seem to hurt us that much , and going to a different language um It doesn't seem to matter {disfmarker} The difference between three and four is not particularly great , so that means that {pause} whether you have the language in or not is not such a big deal .
PhD D : Mmm .
Professor B : It sounds like um {pause} uh {pause} we may need to have more {pause} of uh things that are similar to a target language or {disfmarker} I mean . {pause} You have the same number of parameters in the neural net , you haven't increased the size of the neural net , and maybe there 's just {disfmarker} {pause} just not enough {pause} complexity to it to represent {pause} the variab increased variability in the {disfmarker} in the training set . That {disfmarker} that could be . Um {pause} So , what about {disfmarker} So these are results with {pause} uh th {pause} that you 're describing now , that {pause} they are pretty similar for the different features or {disfmarker} {pause} or uh {disfmarker}
PhD D : Uh , let me check . Uh .
Professor B : Yeah .
PhD D : So . This was for the PLP ,
Professor B : Yeah .
PhD D : Um . The {disfmarker} Yeah . For the PLP with JRASTA the {disfmarker} {pause} the {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} This is quite the same {pause} tendency , {pause} with a slight increase of the error rate , {pause} uh if we go to {disfmarker} to TIMIT . And then it 's {disfmarker} it gets worse with the multilingual . Um . Yeah . There {disfmarker} there is a difference actually with {disfmarker} b between PLP and JRASTA is that {pause} JRASTA {pause} seems to {pause} perform better with the highly mismatched {pause} condition {pause} but slightly {disfmarker} slightly worse {pause} for the well matched condition . Mmm .
Professor B : I have a suggestion , actually , even though it 'll delay us slightly , would {disfmarker} would you mind {pause} running into the other room and making {pause} copies of this ? Cuz we 're all sort of {disfmarker} If we c if we could look at it , while we 're talking , I think it 'd be
PhD D : Yeah , yeah . OK .
Professor B : uh {disfmarker} {pause} Uh , I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll sing a song or dance or something while you {vocalsound} do it , too .
PhD A : So um {disfmarker}
Grad F : Alright .
PhD A : Go ahead . Ah , while you 're gone I 'll ask s some of my questions .
Professor B : Yeah .
PhD A : Um .
Professor B : Yeah . Uh , this way and just slightly to the left , yeah .
PhD A : The um {disfmarker} What was {disfmarker} Was this number {pause} forty or {disfmarker} It was roughly the same as this one , {pause} he said ? When you had the two language versus the three language ?
Professor B : Um . That 's what he was saying .
PhD A : That 's where he removed English ,
Grad F : Yeah .
PhD A : right ?
Professor B : Right .
Grad F : It sometimes , actually , depends on what features you 're using .
Professor B : Yeah . But {disfmarker} but i it sounds like {disfmarker}
Grad F : Um , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} He {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .
Professor B : I mean . That 's interesting because {pause} it {disfmarker} it seems like what it 's saying is not so much that you got hurt {pause} uh because {pause} you {pause} uh didn't have so much representation of English , because in the other case you don't get hurt any more , at least when {pause} it seemed like uh it {disfmarker} it might simply be a case that you have something that is just much more diverse ,
PhD A : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : but you have the same number of parameters representing it .
PhD A : Mm - hmm . I wonder {disfmarker} were um all three of these nets {pause} using the same output ? This multi - language {pause} uh labelling ?
Grad F : He was using uh sixty - four phonemes from {pause} SAMPA .
PhD A : OK , OK .
Grad F : Yeah .
PhD A : So this would {disfmarker} {pause} From this you would say , "" well , it doesn't really matter if we put Finnish {pause} into {pause} the training of the neural net , {pause} if there 's {pause} gonna be , {pause} you know , Finnish in the test data . "" Right ?
Professor B : Well , it 's {disfmarker} it sounds {disfmarker} {pause} I mean , we have to be careful , cuz we haven't gotten a good result yet .
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor B : And comparing different bad results can be {pause} tricky .
PhD A : Hmm .
Professor B : But I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {pause} I think it does suggest that it 's not so much uh {pause} uh cross {pause} language as cross type of speech .
PhD A : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : It 's {disfmarker} it 's um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But we did {disfmarker} Oh yeah , the other thing I was asking him , though , is that I think that in the case {disfmarker} Yeah , you {disfmarker} you do have to be careful because of com compounded results . I think we got some earlier results {pause} in which you trained on one language and tested on another and you didn't have {pause} three , but you just had one {pause} language . So you trained on {pause} one type of digits and tested on another . Didn - Wasn't there something of that ? Where you , {pause} say , trained on Spanish and tested on {disfmarker} on TI - digits , or the other way around ? Something like that ?
PhD E : No .
Professor B : I thought there was something like that , {pause} that he showed me {pause} last week . We 'll have to wait till we get {disfmarker}
PhD A : Yeah , that would be interesting .
Professor B : Um , This may have been what I was asking before , Stephane , but {disfmarker} {pause} but , um , wasn't there something that you did , {pause} where you trained {pause} on one language and tested on another ? I mean no {disfmarker} no mixture but just {disfmarker}
Grad F : I 'll get it for you .
PhD D : Uh , no , no .
Professor B : We 've never just trained on one lang
PhD D : Training on a single language , you mean , and testing on the other one ?
Professor B : Yeah .
PhD D : Uh , no .
PhD E : Not yet .
PhD D : So the only {pause} task that 's similar to this is the training on two languages , and {comment} that {disfmarker}
Professor B : But we 've done a bunch of things where we just trained on one language . Right ? I mean , you haven't {disfmarker} you haven't done all your tests on multiple languages .
PhD D : Uh , No . Either thi this is test with {pause} uh the same language {pause} but from the broad data , or it 's test with {pause} uh different languages also from the broad data , excluding the {disfmarker} So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's three or {disfmarker} three and four .
PhD E : The early experiment that {disfmarker}
PhD A : Did you do different languages from digits ?
PhD D : Uh . No . You mean {pause} training digits {pause} on one language and using the net {pause} to recognize on the other ?
PhD A : Digits on another language ?
PhD D : No .
Professor B : See , I thought you showed me something like that last week . You had a {disfmarker} you had a little {disfmarker}
PhD D : Uh , {pause} No , I don't think so .
Professor B : Um What {disfmarker}
PhD C : These numbers are uh {pause} ratio to baseline ?
Professor B : So , I mean wha what 's the {disfmarker}
PhD D : So .
Professor B : This {disfmarker} this chart {disfmarker} this table that we 're looking at {pause} is um , show is all testing for TI - digits , or {disfmarker} ?
Grad F : Bigger is worse .
PhD D : So you have uh basically two {pause} uh parts .
Grad F : This is error rate , I think .
PhD C : Ratio .
Grad F : No . {pause} No .
PhD D : The upper part is for TI - digits
Grad F : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
PhD D : and it 's divided in three {pause} rows {pause} of four {disfmarker} four rows each .
Grad F : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : Yeah .
PhD D : And the first four rows is well - matched , then the s the second group of four rows is mismatched , and {pause} finally highly mismatched . And then the lower part is for Italian and it 's the same {disfmarker} {pause} the same thing .
PhD A : So , so the upper part is training {pause} TI - digits ?
PhD D : So . It 's {disfmarker} it 's the HTK results , I mean . So it 's {pause} HTK training testings {pause} with different kind of features
PhD A : Ah .
PhD D : and what appears in the {pause} uh left column is {pause} the networks that are used for doing this .
Professor B : Hmm .
PhD D : So . Uh Yeah .
Professor B : Well , What was is that i What was it that you had {pause} done {pause} last week when you showed {disfmarker} Do you remember ? Wh - when you showed me {pause} the {disfmarker} your table last week ?
PhD D : It - It was part of these results . Mmm . Mmm .
PhD A : So where is the baseline {pause} for the TI - digits {pause} located in here ?
PhD D : You mean the HTK Aurora baseline ?
PhD A : Yeah .
PhD D : It 's uh the one hundred number . It 's , well , all these numbers are the ratio {pause} with respect to the baseline .
PhD A : Ah ! Ah , OK , OK .
Professor B : So this is word {disfmarker} word error rate , so a high number is bad .
PhD D : Yeah , this is {pause} a word error rate ratio .
PhD E : Yeah .
PhD A : OK , I see .
PhD D : Yeah . So , seventy point two means that {pause} we reduced the error rate uh by thirty {disfmarker} thirty percent .
PhD A : OK , OK , gotcha .
PhD D : So .
Professor B : OK , {vocalsound} so if we take
PhD D : Hmm .
Professor B : uh um let 's see PLP {pause} uh with on - line {pause} normalization and {pause} delta - del so that 's this thing you have circled here {pause} in the second column ,
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : um {pause} and "" multi - English "" refers to what ?
PhD D : To TIMIT . Mmm . Then you have {pause} uh MF , {pause} MS and ME which are for French , Spanish and English . And , yeah . Actually I {disfmarker} {pause} I uh forgot to say that {pause} the multilingual net are trained {pause} on {pause} uh {pause} features without the s derivatives uh but with {pause} increased frame numbers . Mmm . And we can {disfmarker} we can see on the first line of the table that it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} {pause} it 's slightly {disfmarker} slightly worse when we don't use delta but it 's not {disfmarker} {pause} not that much .
Professor B : Right . So w w So , I 'm sorry . I missed that . What 's MF , MS and ME ?
PhD A : Multi - French , Multi - Spanish
PhD D : So . Multi - French , Multi - Spanish , and Multi - English .
Professor B : Uh OK . So , it 's {pause} uh {pause} broader vocabulary . Then {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : OK so I think what I 'm {disfmarker} what I saw in your smaller chart that I was thinking of was {disfmarker} was {pause} there were some numbers I saw , I think , that included these multiple languages and it {disfmarker} and I was seeing {pause} that it got worse . I {disfmarker} I think that was all it was . You had some very limited results that {disfmarker} at that point
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : which showed {pause} having in these {disfmarker} these other languages . In fact it might have been just this last category , {pause} having two languages broad that were {disfmarker} where {disfmarker} where English was removed . So that was cross language and the {disfmarker} and the result was quite poor . What I {disfmarker} {pause} we hadn't seen yet was that if you added in the English , it 's still poor .
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : Uh {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um now , what 's the noise condition {pause} um {pause} of the training data {disfmarker}
PhD D : Still poor .
Professor B : Well , I think this is what you were explaining . The noise condition is the same {disfmarker} It 's the same uh Aurora noises uh , in all these cases {pause} for the training .
PhD D : Yeah . Yeah .
Professor B : So there 's not a {pause} statistical {disfmarker} sta a strong st {pause} statistically different {pause} noise characteristic between {pause} uh the training and test
PhD D : No these are the s s s same noises ,
Professor B : and yet we 're seeing some kind of effect {disfmarker}
PhD D : yeah . At least {disfmarker} at least for the first {disfmarker} {pause} for the well - matched ,
Grad F : Well matched condition .
Professor B : Right .
PhD D : yeah .
Professor B : So there 's some kind of a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} an effect from having these {disfmarker} uh this broader coverage um Now I guess what we should try doing with this is try {pause} testing these on u this same sort of thing on {disfmarker} you probably must have this {pause} lined up to do . To try the same t {pause} with the exact same training , do testing on {pause} the other languages .
PhD D : Mmm .
Professor B : On {disfmarker} on um {disfmarker} So . Um , oh I well , wait a minute . You have this here , for the Italian . That 's right . OK , so , {pause} So .
PhD D : Yeah . Yeah , so for the Italian the results are {vocalsound} uh {pause} stranger um {pause} Mmm . So what appears is that perhaps Spanish is {pause} not very close to Italian because uh , well , {pause} when using the {disfmarker} the network trained only on Spanish it 's {disfmarker} {pause} the error rate is {pause} almost uh twice {pause} the baseline error rate .
Professor B : Mm - hmm .
PhD D : Mmm . {vocalsound} Uh .
Professor B : Well , I mean , let 's see . Is there any difference in {disfmarker} So it 's in {pause} the uh {disfmarker} So you 're saying that {pause} when you train on English {pause} and {pause} uh {pause} and {disfmarker} and test on {disfmarker}
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : No , you don't have training on English testing {disfmarker}
PhD D : There {disfmarker} there is {disfmarker} another difference , is that the noise {disfmarker} the noises are different .
Professor B : In {disfmarker} in what ?
PhD D : Well , For {disfmarker} for the Italian part I mean the {pause} uh {pause} the um {pause} networks are trained with noise from {pause} Aurora {disfmarker} TI - digits ,
PhD E : Aurora - two .
PhD D : mmm .
Professor B : And the noise is different in th
PhD D : Yeah . And perhaps the noise are {pause} quite different from the noises {pause} in the speech that Italian .
Professor B : Do we have any um {pause} test sets {pause} uh in {pause} any other language that um have the same noise as in {pause} the Aurora ?
PhD D : And {disfmarker}
PhD E : Mmm , no .
PhD D : No .
PhD A : Can I ask something real quick ? In {disfmarker} in the upper part {disfmarker} {pause} in the English {pause} stuff , {pause} it looks like the very best number is sixty point nine ? and that 's in the uh {disfmarker} {pause} the third {pause} section in the upper part under PLP JRASTA , sort of the middle column ?
PhD D : Yeah .
PhD A : I is that {pause} a noisy condition ?
PhD D : Yeah .
PhD A : So that 's matched training ? Is that what that is ?
PhD D : It 's {disfmarker} no , the third part , so it 's uh {pause} highly mismatched . So . Training and {pause} test noise are different .
PhD A : So {disfmarker} why do you get your best number in {disfmarker} Wouldn't you get your best number in the clean case ?
PhD C : Well , it 's relative to the um {pause} baseline mismatching
PhD D : Yeah .
PhD A : Ah ,
PhD D : Yeah . Yeah .
PhD A : OK so these are not {disfmarker} OK , alright , I see .
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD A : OK . And then {disfmarker} so , in the {disfmarker} in the um {disfmarker} {pause} in the {pause} non - mismatched clean case , {pause} your best one was under MFCC ? That sixty - one point four ?
PhD D : Yeah . {pause} But it 's not a clean case . It 's {pause} a noisy case but {pause} uh training and test noises are the same .
PhD A : Oh ! So this upper third ?
PhD D : So {disfmarker} Yeah .
PhD A : Uh that 's still noisy ?
PhD D : Yeah .
PhD A : Ah , OK .
PhD D : So it 's always noisy basically ,
PhD A : Mm - hmm .
PhD D : and , {pause} well , the {disfmarker}
PhD A : I see .
PhD D : Mmm .
Professor B : OK ? Um {pause} So uh , I think this will take some {pause} looking at , thinking about . But , {pause} what is uh {disfmarker} what is currently running , that 's {disfmarker} uh , i that {disfmarker} just filling in the holes here or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} ? {comment} {pause} pretty much ?
PhD D : Uh , no we don't plan to fill the holes
Professor B : OK .
PhD D : but {pause} actually there is something important , is that {pause} um we made a lot of assumption concerning the on - line normalization and we just noticed {pause} uh recently that {pause} uh the {pause} approach that we were using {pause} was not {pause} uh {pause} leading to very good results {pause} when we {pause} used the straight features to HTK . Um {pause} {pause} Mmm . So basically d {pause} if you look at the {disfmarker} at the left of the table , {pause} the first uh row , {pause} with eighty - six , one hundred , and forty - three and seventy - five , these are the results we obtained for Italian {pause} uh with {pause} straight {pause} mmm , PLP features {pause} using on - line normalization .
Professor B : Mm - hmm .
PhD D : Mmm . And the , mmm {disfmarker} what 's {pause} in the table , just {pause} at the left of the PLP twelve {pause} on - line normalization column , so , the numbers seventy - nine , fifty - four and {pause} uh forty - two {pause} are the results obtained by uh Pratibha with {pause} uh his on - line normalization {disfmarker} uh her on - line normalization approach .
PhD A : Where is that ? seventy - nine , fifty
Professor B : Uh , it 's just sort of sitting right on the uh {disfmarker} the column line .
PhD D : So .
PhD E : Fifty - one ? This {disfmarker}
PhD A : Oh I see , OK .
Professor B : Uh . {pause} Yeah .
PhD D : Just {disfmarker} uh Yeah . So these are the results of {pause} OGI with {pause} on - line normalization and straight features to HTK . And the previous result , eighty - six and so on , {pause} are with our {pause} features straight to HTK .
Professor B : Yes . Yes .
PhD D : So {pause} what we see that {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} there is that um {pause} uh the way we were doing this was not correct , but {pause} still {pause} the networks {pause} are very good . When we use the networks {pause} our number are better that {pause} uh Pratibha results .
PhD E : We improve .
Professor B : So , do you know what was wrong with the on - line normalization , or {disfmarker} ?
PhD D : Yeah . There were diff there were different things and {pause} basically , {pause} the first thing is the mmm , {pause} alpha uh {pause} value . So , the recursion {pause} uh {pause} part . um , {pause} I used point five percent , {pause} which was the default value in the {disfmarker} {pause} in the programs here . And Pratibha used five percent .
Professor B : Uh
PhD D : So it adapts more {pause} quickly
Professor B : Yes . Yeah .
PhD D : Um , but , yeah . I assume that this was not important because {pause} uh previous results from {disfmarker} from Dan and {disfmarker} show that basically {pause} the {pause} both {disfmarker} both values g give the same {disfmarker} same {pause} uh results . It was true on uh ";yes;3;yes;3;yes;3;yes;2;yes;3;yes;1;yes;2
"Professor C : Uh , is it the twenty - fourth ?
PhD F : now we 're on .
Professor C : Yeah .
PhD A : Uh Chuck , is the mike type wireless {disfmarker}
PhD F : Yes .
PhD A : wireless headset ? OK .
PhD F : Yes .
Professor C : Yeah .
PhD F : For you it is .
Professor C : Yeah . We uh {disfmarker} we abandoned the lapel because they sort of were not too {disfmarker} not too hot , not too cold , they were {disfmarker} you know , they were {vocalsound} uh , far enough away that you got more background noise , uh , and uh {disfmarker} and so forth
PhD A : Uh - huh .
Professor C : but they weren't so close that they got quite the {disfmarker} you know , the really good {disfmarker} No , th
PhD A : OK .
Professor C : they {disfmarker} I mean they didn't {disfmarker} Wait a minute . I 'm saying that wrong . They were not so far away that they were really good representative distant mikes ,
PhD A : Uh - huh .
Professor C : but on the other hand they were not so close that they got rid of all the interference . So it was no {disfmarker} didn't seem to be a good point to them . On the other hand if you only had to have one mike in some ways you could argue the lapel was a good choice , precisely because it 's in the middle .
PhD A : Yeah , yeah .
Professor C : There 's uh , some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get with the lapel uh , little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel , but given the choice we {disfmarker} there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh , getting rid of lapels .
PhD A : The mike number is {disfmarker}
Professor C : So ,
PhD F : Uh , your mike number 's written on the back of that unit there .
PhD A : Oh yeah . One .
PhD F : And then the channel number 's usually one less than that .
PhD A : Oh , OK . OK .
PhD F : It - it 's one less than what 's written on the back of your {disfmarker}
PhD A : OK . OK .
PhD F : yeah . So you should be zero , actually .
PhD A : Hello ? Yeah .
PhD F : For your uh , channel number .
PhD A : Yep , yep .
Professor C : And you should do a lot of talking so we get a lot more of your pronunciations . no , they don't {disfmarker} don't have a {disfmarker} have any Indian pronunciations .
PhD F : So what we usually do is um , we typically will have our meetings
Professor C : Yeah .
PhD F : and then at the end of the meetings we 'll read the digits . Everybody goes around and reads the digits on the {disfmarker} the bottom of their forms .
Professor C : Session R
PhD D : R - nineteen ?
PhD A : OK .
Professor C : R - nineteen .
PhD F : Yeah . We 're {disfmarker} This is session R - nineteen .
Professor C : If you say so . O K . Do we have anything like an agenda ? What 's going on ? Um . I guess um . So . One thing {disfmarker}
PhD F : Sunil 's here for the summer ?
Professor C : Sunil 's here for the summer , right . Um , so , one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting maybe uh , and then just uh , I guess uh , progress reports individually , and then uh , plans for where we go between now and then , pretty much . Um .
PhD F : I could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here , so that people in the group know .
Professor C : Mm - hmm . OK . Why don't you start with that ? That 's sort of {disfmarker}
PhD F : OK .
Professor C : Yeah ?
PhD F : We um {disfmarker} So we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm . And um , uh , we ordered uh , SUN - Blade - one - hundreds , and um , I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running {disfmarker} So the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running P - make and Customs here and Andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . And he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , {vocalsound} run things using P - make and Customs . You don't actually have to write P - make scripts and things like that . The simplest thing {disfmarker} And I can send an email around or , maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something . Um ,
Professor C : How about an email that points to the FAQ ,
PhD F : there 's a c
Professor C : you know what I 'm saying ?
PhD F : Yeah , yeah .
Professor C : so that you can {disfmarker} Yeah .
PhD F : Uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called "" run command "" . "" Run dash command "" , "" run hyphen command "" . And , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh {disfmarker} and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . So you can try this as a simple test with uh , the L S command . So you can say "" run dash command L S "" , and , um , it 'll actually export that {vocalsound} LS command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an LS on your current directory . So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run , and um {disfmarker} And that 's a simple way to get started using {disfmarker} using this . And , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , {vocalsound} um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . Now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it . Uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like "" run command "" , you can specify those attributes for your program . For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux , you can give it the Linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that . So . You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . If there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . So , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh , right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it and we 're {disfmarker} Uh . The SRI recognizer has all this P - make customs stuff built into it .
Professor C : So as I understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines ,
PhD F : So .
Professor C : is the rough division of {disfmarker}
PhD F : Yeah . Exactly . Yeah , you know , I {disfmarker} I sort of got started {comment} using the recognizer just recently and uh , uh I fired off a training job , and then I fired off a recognition job and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying , "" uh , are you running two {vocalsound} trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run . "" So I had to back off a little bit . But , soon as we get some more machines then uh {disfmarker} then we 'll have more compute available . So , um , that 's just a quick update about what we 've got . So .
Grad G : Um , I have {disfmarker} I have a question about the uh , parallelization ?
PhD F : Mm - hmm .
Grad G : So , um , let 's say I have like , a thousand little {disfmarker} little jobs to do ?
PhD F : Mm - hmm .
Grad G : Um , how do I do it with "" run command "" ? I mean do {disfmarker}
PhD F : You could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job
Grad G : Uh - huh . A thousand times ?
PhD F : right ? But you probably wanna be careful with that
Grad G : OK .
PhD F : because um , you don't wanna saturate the network . Uh , so , um , you know , you should {disfmarker} you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time , uh , just because then it would keep other people {disfmarker}
Grad G : Oh , too much file transfer and stuff .
PhD F : Well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with {disfmarker} if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . Um ,
Grad G : OK .
PhD F : so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time . Um . So if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run , um , you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use "" run command "" , uh , to only have ten of those going at a time . And uh , then , when one of those finished you 'd fire off another one . Um ,
Professor C : I remember I {disfmarker} I forget whether it was when the Rutgers or {disfmarker} or Hopkins workshop , I remember one of the workshops I was at there were {disfmarker} everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of P - make like thing that sit sent things out .
PhD F : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Professor C : So all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines
PhD F : Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Professor C : and {vocalsound} and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine .
PhD F : Yeah . Yep . Yeah , exactly . Yeah , you have to be a little bit careful .
Professor C : as I recall , but . Yeah .
PhD D : Hmm .
PhD F : Um , but uh , you can also {disfmarker} If you have that level of parallelization um , and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in {disfmarker} in a Perl script to take care of that , you can use um , P - make
Grad G : Just do P - make .
PhD F : and {disfmarker} and you basically write a Make file that uh , you know your final job depends on these one thousand things ,
Grad G : s Mm - hmm .
PhD F : and when you run P - make , uh , on your Make file , you can give it the dash capital J and {disfmarker} and then a number ,
Grad G : Mm - hmm .
PhD F : and that number represents how many uh , machines to use at once . And then it 'll make sure that it never goes above that .
Grad G : Right .
PhD F : So ,
Grad G : Right . OK .
PhD F : I can get some documentation .
PhD D : So it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's not systematically queued . I mean all the jobs are running . If you launch twenty jobs , they are all running . Alright .
PhD F : It depends . If you {disfmarker} "" Run command "" , that I mentioned before , is {disfmarker} doesn't know about other things that you might be running .
PhD D : Uh - huh .
PhD F : So , it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once ,
PhD D : Right .
PhD F : and they wouldn't know about each other . But if you use P - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run
PhD D : Mm - hmm .
PhD F : and it can control , uh , how many it runs simultaneously .
Professor C : So "" run command "" doesn't use P - make , or {disfmarker} ?
PhD F : It uses "" export "" underlyingly . But , if you {disfmarker} i It 's meant to be run one job at a time ? So you could fire off a thousand of those , and it doesn't know {disfmarker} any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running .
Professor C : So why would one use that rather than P - make ?
PhD F : Well , if you have , um {disfmarker} Like , for example , uh if you didn't wanna write a P - make script and you just had a , uh {disfmarker} an HTK training job that you know is gonna take uh , six hours to run , and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use , you can say "" run command "" and your HTK thing and it 'll find another machine , the fastest currently available machine and {disfmarker} and run your job there .
Professor C : Now , does it have the same sort of behavior as P - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it {disfmarker}
PhD F : Yes . Yeah , there are um {disfmarker} Right . So some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called "" no evict "" . And if you specify that , in {disfmarker} in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from .
Professor C : Mm - hmm .
PhD F : But , the machines that don't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and {disfmarker} and they were at lunch ,
Professor C : Mm - hmm .
PhD F : they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted {disfmarker} your job {comment} will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . Automatically . So {disfmarker} which can cause you to lose time , right ? If you had a two hour job , and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted . So . If you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus {disfmarker} the attribute , you know , "" no evict "" , and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from . So .
Professor C : Um , what {disfmarker} what about {disfmarker} I remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you {disfmarker} if something required {disfmarker} if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , but if you were logged into it from home ?
PhD F : Mm - hmm .
Professor C : and you weren't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ?
PhD F : Yeah , I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how that works .
Professor C : Yeah .
PhD F : Uh , it seems like Andreas did something for that .
Professor C : Hmm .
PhD F : Um .
Professor C : OK . We can ask him sometime .
PhD F : But {disfmarker} Yeah . I don't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console TTY , so maybe if you echoed something to the you know , dev {disfmarker} dev console or something .
Professor C : You probably wouldn't ordinarily , though . Yeah . Right ? You probably wouldn't ordinarily .
PhD F : Hmm ?
Professor C : I mean you sort of {disfmarker} you 're at home and you 're trying to log in , and it takes forever to even log you in , and you probably go , "" screw this "" ,
PhD F : Yeah , yeah .
Professor C : and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You know .
PhD F : Yeah . Yeah , so , um ,
Professor C : Yeah .
PhD F : yeah . I {disfmarker} I can {disfmarker} I 'm not sure about that one .
Professor C : yeah .
PhD F : But uh .
Professor C : OK .
PhD A : Uh , I need a little orientation about this environment and uh scr s how to run some jobs here because I never d did anything so far with this X emissions
PhD F : OK .
PhD A : So , I think maybe I 'll ask you after the meeting .
PhD F : Um . Yeah . Yeah , and {disfmarker} and also uh , Stephane 's a {disfmarker} a really good resource for that if you can't find me .
PhD A : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yep . OK , sure
PhD D : Mmm .
PhD F : Especially with regard to the Aurora stuff .
PhD A : OK .
PhD F : He {disfmarker} he knows that stuff better than I do .
Professor C : OK . Well , why don't we uh , uh , Sunil since you 're {vocalsound} haven't {disfmarker} haven't been at one of these yet , why don't yo you tell us what 's {disfmarker} what 's up with you ? Wh - what you 've been up to , hopefully .
PhD A : Um . Yeah . So , uh , shall I start from {disfmarker} Well I don't know how may I {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} OK . Uh , I think I 'll start from the post uh Aurora submission maybe .
Professor C : Yeah .
PhD A : Uh , yeah , after the submission the {disfmarker} what I 've been working on mainly was to take {disfmarker} take other s submissions and then over their system , what they submitted , because we didn't have any speech enhancement system in {disfmarker} in ours . So {disfmarker} So I tried uh , And u First I tried just LDA . And then I found that uh , I mean , if {disfmarker} if I combine it with LDA , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs . Uh {disfmarker}
PhD F : Are y are you saying LDA ?
PhD A : Yeah . Yeah .
PhD F : LDA . OK .
PhD A : So , just {disfmarker} just the LDA filters . I just plug in {disfmarker} I just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in LDA on top of that . But the LDA filter that I used was different from what we submitted in the proposal .
PhD F : Mm - hmm .
PhD A : What I did was {vocalsound} I took the LDA filter 's design using clean speech , uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so , instead of using this , uh , narrow {disfmarker} narrow band LDA filter that we submitted uh , I got new filters . So that seems to be giving {disfmarker} uh , improving over their uh , system . Slightly . But , not very significantly . And uh , that was uh , showing any improvement over {disfmarker} final {disfmarker} by plugging in an LDA . And uh , so then after {disfmarker} after that I {disfmarker} I added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that . And that {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there also I n I found that I have to make some changes to their time constant that I used because th it has a {disfmarker} a mean and variance update time constant and {disfmarker} which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one . But um , I didn't {disfmarker} I didn't play with that time constant a lot , I just t g I just found that I have to reduce the value {disfmarker} I mean , I have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value . That 's all I found So I have to . Uh , Yeah . And uh , uh , the other {disfmarker} other thing what I tried was , I just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information , just the Aurora baseline , to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the {disfmarker} I mean the w speech and nonspeech . And uh , I found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh .
Professor C : Uh , can you back up a second , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I missed something , uh , I guess my mind wandered . Ad - ad When you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ?
PhD A : Yeah . No .
Professor C : or is it ?
PhD A : No . No , things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used .
Professor C : Did it not ? No , no . With a different time constant .
PhD A : With the different time constant I found that {disfmarker} I mean , I didn't get an improvement over not using on - line normalization ,
Professor C : Oh .
PhD A : because I {disfmarker} I found that I would have change the value of the update factor .
Professor C : No you didn't , OK .
PhD A : But I didn't play it with play {disfmarker} play quite a bit to make it better than .
Professor C : Yeah .
PhD A : So , it 's still not {disfmarker}
Professor C : OK .
PhD A : I mean , the on - line normalization didn't give me any improvement .
Professor C : OK .
PhD A : And uh , so ,
Professor C : OK .
PhD A : oh yeah So I just stopped there with the uh , speech enhancement . The {disfmarker} the other thing what I tried was the {disfmarker} adding the uh , endpoint information to the baseline and that itself gives like twenty - two percent because the {disfmarker} the second {disfmarker} the new phase is going to be with the endpointed speech . And just to get a feel of how much the baseline itself is going to change by adding this endpoint information , I just , uh , use {disfmarker}
Professor C : Hmm .
PhD F : So people won't even have to worry about , uh , doing speech - nonspeech then .
PhD A : Yeah that 's , that 's what the feeling is like . They 're going to give the endpoint information .
PhD F : Mmm .
Professor C : G I guess the issue is that people do that anyway ,
PhD F : I see .
Professor C : everybody does that ,
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor C : and they wanted to see , given that you 're doing that , what {disfmarker} what are the best features that you should use .
PhD F : Yeah , I see .
PhD A : So ,
Professor C : I mean clearly they 're interact . So I don't know that I entirely agree with it .
PhD F : Yeah .
Professor C : But {disfmarker} but it might be uh {disfmarker} In some ways it might be better t to {disfmarker} rather than giving the endpoints , to have a standard that everybody uses and then interacts with .
PhD F : Mm - hmm .
Professor C : But , you know . It 's {disfmarker} it 's still someth reasonable .
PhD F : So , are people supposed to assume that there is uh {disfmarker} Are {disfmarker} are people not supposed to use any speech outside of those endpoints ?
PhD A : Uh {disfmarker}
PhD F : Or can you then use speech outside of it for estimating background noise and things ?
PhD A : No . No . That i I {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , yeah , exactly . I guess that is {disfmarker} that is where the consensus is . Like y you will {disfmarker} you will {disfmarker} You 'll be given the information about the beginning and the end of speech but the whole speech is available to you .
PhD F : OK .
PhD A : So .
Professor C : So it should make the spectral subtraction style things work even better ,
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor C : because you don't have the mistakes in it . Yeah ?
PhD A : Yeah . So {disfmarker}
Professor C : OK .
PhD A : So that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} The baseline itself {disfmarker} I mean , it improves by twenty - two percent . I found that in s one of the SpeechDat - Car cases , that like , the Spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint . w
PhD F : Wow .
PhD A : I mean you don't need any further speech enhancement with fifty . So , uh ,
PhD F : So the baseline itself improves by fifty percent .
PhD A : Yeah , by fifty percent .
Professor C : Yeah .
PhD F : Wow .
Professor C : So it 's g it 's gonna be harder to {vocalsound} beat that actually .
PhD F : Yeah .
PhD A : Yeah , so {disfmarker}
Professor C : But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker}
PhD A : so that is when uh , the {disfmarker} the qualification criteria was reduced from fifty percent to something like twenty - five percent for well - matched . And I think they have {disfmarker} they have actually changed their qualification c criteria now . And uh , Yeah , I guess after that , I just went home f I just had a vacation fo for four weeks . Uh .
Professor C : OK . No , that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's a good {disfmarker} good update .
PhD A : Ye Yeah , and I {disfmarker} I came back and I started working on uh , some other speech enhancement algorithm . I mean , so {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} from the submission what I found that people have tried spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering . These are the main uh , approaches where people have tried ,
Professor C : Yeah .
PhD A : so just to {disfmarker} just to fill the space with some f few more speech enhancement algorithms to see whether it improves a lot , I {disfmarker} I 've been working on this uh , signal subspace approach for speech enhancement where you take the noisy signal and then decomposing the signal s and the noise subspace and then try to estimate the clean speech from the signal plus noise subspace . And {disfmarker}
Professor C : Mm - hmm .
PhD A : So , I 've been actually running some s So far I 've been trying it only on Matlab . I have to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to test whether it works first or not
Professor C : Yeah .
PhD A : and then I 'll p port it to C and I 'll update it with the repository once I find it it giving any some positive result . So , yeah .
Professor C : S So you s you So you said one thing I want to jump on for a second . So {disfmarker} so now you 're {disfmarker} you 're getting tuned into the repository thing that he has here
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor C : and {disfmarker} so we we 'll have a {vocalsound} single place where the stuff is .
PhD A : Yep . Yeah .
Professor C : Cool . Um , so maybe uh , just briefly , you could remind us about the related experiments . Cuz you did some stuff that you talked about last week , I guess ?
PhD D : Mm - hmm .
Professor C : Um , where you were also combining something {disfmarker} both of you I guess were both combining something from the uh , French Telecom system with {vocalsound} the u uh {disfmarker}
PhD D : Right .
Professor C : I {disfmarker} I don't know whether it was system one or system two , or {disfmarker} ?
PhD D : Mm - hmm . It was system one . So
Professor C : OK .
PhD D : we {disfmarker} The main thing that we did is just to take the spectral subtraction from the France Telecom , which provide us some speech samples that are uh , with noise removed .
Professor C : So I let me {disfmarker} let me just stop you there . So then , one distinction is that uh , you were taking the actual France Telecom features and then applying something to {disfmarker}
PhD A : Uh , no there is a slight different . Uh I mean , which are extracted at the handset because they had another back - end blind equalization {disfmarker}
Professor C : Yeah .
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor C : Yeah . But that 's what I mean .
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor C : But u u Sorry ,
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor C : yeah , I 'm not being {disfmarker} I 'm not being clear .
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor C : What I meant was you had something like cepstra or something , right ?
PhD A : Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Professor C : And so one difference is that , I guess you were taking spectra .
PhD A : The speech .
PhD B : Yeah .
PhD D : Yeah . But I guess it 's the s exactly the same thing because on the heads uh , handset they just applied this Wiener filter and then compute cepstral features ,
PhD A : Yeah , the cepstral f The difference is like {disfmarker} There may be a slight difference in the way {disfmarker}
PhD D : right ? or {disfmarker} ?
PhD A : because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech . I mean , if we are using our own code for th I mean that {disfmarker} that could be the only difference .
PhD D : Right .
PhD A : I mean , there is no other difference .
PhD D : Mm - hmm .
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor C : But you got some sort of different result . So I 'm trying to understand it . But uh , I th
PhD D : Yeah , well I think we should uh , have a table with all the result because I don't know I uh , I don't exactly know what are your results ? But ,
PhD A : OK . OK .
PhD D : Mmm . Yeah , but so we did this , and another difference I guess is that we just applied uh , proposal - one system after this without {disfmarker} well , with our modification to reduce the delay of the {disfmarker} the LDA filters ,
PhD A : Uh - huh .
PhD D : and
PhD B : And the filter {disfmarker}
PhD D : Well there are slight modifications , but it was the full proposal - one . In your case , if you tried just putting LDA , then maybe on - line normalization {disfmarker} ?
PhD A : Only LDA . Yeah . Af - I {disfmarker} after that I added on - line normalization , yeah .
PhD D : Mm - hmm . So we just tried directly to {disfmarker} to just , keep the system as it was and , um , when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves uh , signif significantly . Um , but , what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the on - line normalization .
PhD A : Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
PhD D : Because if we keep the value that was submitted uh , it doesn't help at all . You can remove on - line normalization , or put it , it doesn't change anything . Uh , uh , as long as you have the spectral subtraction . But , you can still find some kind of optimum somewhere , and we don't know where exactly
PhD A : Yeah .
PhD D : but , uh .
PhD A : Yeah , I assume .
Professor C : So it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something
PhD D : Right .
PhD A : Yeah .
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor C : and see where i where the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} where they were different and what we can learn from it .
PhD D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
PhD A : without any change . OK .
PhD B : But it 's {disfmarker}
PhD D : Yeah . Well ,
PhD B : It 's the new .
PhD D : with {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} with changes ,
PhD A : with
PhD B : The new .
PhD D : because we change it the system to have {disfmarker}
PhD A : Oh yeah , I mean the {disfmarker} the new LDA filters .
PhD B : The new .
PhD A : I mean {disfmarker} OK .
PhD D : Yeah . LDA filters . There are other things that we finally were shown to improve also like , the sixty - four hertz cut - off .
PhD A : Mm - hmm .
PhD B : Mm - hmm .
PhD D : w Uh , it doesn't seem to hurt on TI - digits , finally .
PhD A : OK .
PhD D : Maybe because of other changes .
PhD A : OK .
PhD D : Um , well there are some {vocalsound} minor changes , yeah .
PhD A : Mm - hmm .
PhD D : And , right now if we look at the results , it 's , um , always better than {disfmarker} it seems always better than France Telecom for mismatch and high - mismatch . And it 's still slightly worse for well - matched .
PhD B : But
PhD D : Um , but this is not significant . But , the problem is that it 's not significant , but if you put this in the , mmm , uh , spreadsheet , it 's still worse . Even with very minor {disfmarker} uh , even if it 's only slightly worse for well - matched .
Professor C : Mm - hmm .
PhD D : And significantly better for HM . Uh , but , well . I don't think it 's importa important because when they will change their metric , uh , uh , mainly because of uh , when you p you plug the um , frame dropping in the baseline system , it will improve a lot HM , and MM ,
PhD A : Yeah .
PhD D : so , um , I guess what will happen {disfmarker} I don't know what will happen . But , the different contribution , I think , for the different test set will be more even .
PhD A : Because the {disfmarker} your improvement on HM and MM will also go down significantly in the spreadsheet so . But the {pause} the well - matched may still {disfmarker}
PhD D : Mm - hmm .
PhD A : I mean the well - matched may be the one which is least affected by adding the endpoint information .
Professor C : Right .
PhD A : Yeah . So the {disfmarker} the MM {disfmarker}
PhD D : Mm - hmm .
PhD A : MM and HM are going to be v hugely affected by it . Yeah .
PhD D : Yeah , so um , yeah .
PhD A : Yeah . But they d the {disfmarker} everything I mean is like , but there that 's how they reduce {disfmarker} why they reduce the qualification to twenty - five percent or some {disfmarker} something on .
PhD D : Mm - hmm .
Professor C : But are they changing the weighting ?
PhD A : Uh , no , I guess they are going ahead with the same weighting .
PhD D : Yeah .
PhD A : Yeah . So there 's nothing on {disfmarker}
Professor C : I don't understand that .
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor C : I guess I {disfmarker} I haven't been part of the discussion , so , um , it seems to me that the well - matched condition is gonna be unusual ,
PhD A : Usual .
Professor C : in this case . Unusual .
PhD A : Uh - huh .
Professor C : Because , um , you don't actually have good matches ordinarily for what any @ @ {disfmarker} particular person 's car is like , or
PhD A : Mmm .
Professor C : uh ,
PhD A : Mmm .
Professor C : It seems like something like the middle one is {disfmarker} is more natural .
PhD A : Hmm . Right .
Professor C : So I don't know why the {pause} well - matched is uh {disfmarker}
PhD D : Mm - hmm .
PhD A : Yeah , but actually the well {disfmarker} well the well - matched um , uh , I mean the {disfmarker} the well - matched condition is not like , uh , the one in TI - digits where uh , you have all the training , uh , conditions exactly like replicated in the testing condition also . It 's like , this is not calibrated by SNR or something . The well - matched has also some {disfmarker} some mismatch in that which is other than the {disfmarker}
Professor C : The well wa matched has mismatch ?
PhD A : has {disfmarker} has also some slight mismatches , unlike the TI - digits where it 's like prefectly matched
PhD F : Perfect to match .
PhD A : because it 's artificially added noise .
Professor C : Yeah .
PhD A : But this is natural recording .
Professor C : Yeah . So remind me of what well - matched meant ?
PhD A : The {disfmarker} the well - matched is like {disfmarker}
Professor C : You 've told me many times .
PhD A : the {disfmarker} the well - matched is defined like it 's seventy percent of the whole database is used for training and thirty percent for testing .
PhD D : Yeah . Well , so it means that if the database is large enough , it 's matched .
PhD A : It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}
PhD D : Because it
PhD A : OK , it 's {disfmarker}
Professor C : Yeah .
PhD D : in each set you have a range of conditions {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}
Professo";yes;3;yes;3;yes;2;yes;4;yes;3;yes;2;yes;2
"PhD A : OK , we 're going .
PhD C : Eight , eight ?
PhD D : This is three .
PhD C : Three .
PhD D : Yep . Yep .
Professor B : Test . Hmm . Let 's see . Move it bit . Test ? Test ? OK , I guess it 's alright . So , let 's see . Yeah , Barry 's not here and Dave 's not here . Um , I can say about {disfmarker} just q just quickly to get through it , that Dave and I submitted this ASRU .
PhD A : This is for ASRU .
Professor B : Yeah . So . Um . Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's interesting . I mean , basically we 're dealing with rever reverberation , and , um , when we deal with pure reverberation , the technique he 's using works really , really well . Uh , and when they had the reverberation here , uh , we 'll measure the signal - to - noise ratio and it 's , uh , about nine DB . So ,
PhD D : Hmm .
Professor B : um ,
PhD A : You mean , from the actual , uh , recordings ?
Professor B : a fair amount of {disfmarker}
PhD D : k
PhD A : It 's nine DB ?
Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . Um {disfmarker} And actually it brought up a question which may be relevant to the Aurora stuff too . Um , I know that when you figured out the filters that we 're using for the Mel scale , there was some experimentation that went on at {disfmarker} at , uh {disfmarker} at OGI . Um , but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using , {comment} the {disfmarker} the Aurora HTK system baseline system {comment} and the system that we were {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the uh , other system we were using , the uh , the SRI system , was that the SRI system had maybe a , um , hundred hertz high - pass . And the , uh , Aurora HTK , it was like twenty .
PhD D : Yep . S sixty - four .
Professor B : Uh .
PhD D : S sixty - four .
Professor B : Sixty - four ? Uh .
PhD D : Yeah , if you 're using the baseline .
Professor B : Is that the ba band center ?
PhD D : No , the edge .
Professor B : The edge is really , uh , sixty - four ?
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : For some reason , uh , Dave thought it was twenty ,
PhD D :  So the , uh , center would be somewhere around like hundred
Professor B : but .
PhD D : and {disfmarker} hundred and {disfmarker} hundred {disfmarker} hundred and {disfmarker} maybe {disfmarker} it 's like {disfmarker} fi hundred hertz .
Professor B : But do you know , for instance , h how far down it would be at twenty hertz ? What the {disfmarker} how much rejection would there be at twenty hertz , let 's say ?
PhD D : At twenty hertz .
Professor B : Yeah , any idea what the curve looks like ?
PhD D : Twenty hertz frequency {disfmarker} Oh , it 's {disfmarker} it 's zero at twenty hertz , right ? The filter ?
PhD C : Yea - actually , the left edge of the first filter is at sixty - four .
PhD D : Sixt - s sixty - four .
PhD C : So {disfmarker}
PhD D : So anything less than sixty - four is zero .
PhD C : Mmm .
Professor B : It 's actually set to zero ? What kind of filter is that ?
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : Is this {disfmarker} oh , from the {disfmarker} from {disfmarker}
PhD C : It {disfmarker} This is the filter bank in the frequency domain that starts at sixty - four .
Professor B : Oh , so you , uh {disfmarker} so you really set it to zero , the FFT ?
PhD D : Yeah ,
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD D : yeah . So it 's {disfmarker} it 's a weight on the ball spectrum . Triangular weighting .
Professor B : Right . OK . Um {disfmarker} OK . So that 's {disfmarker} that 's a little different than Dave thought , I think . But {disfmarker} but , um , still , it 's possible that we 're getting in some more noise . So I wonder , is it {disfmarker} @ @ Was there {disfmarker} their experimentation with , uh , say , throwing away that filter or something ? And , uh {disfmarker}
PhD D : Uh , throwing away the first ?
Professor B : Yeah .
PhD D : Um , yeah , we {disfmarker} we 've tried including the full {disfmarker} full bank . Right ? From zero to four K .
PhD C : Mm - hmm .
PhD D : And that 's always worse than using sixty - four hertz .
Professor B : Right , but the question is , whether sixty - four hertz is {disfmarker} is , uh , too , uh , low .
PhD D : Yeah , I mean , make it a hundred or so ?
Professor B : Yeah .
PhD D : I t I think I 've tried a hundred and it was more or less the same , or slightly worse .
Professor B : On what test set ?
PhD D : On the same , uh , SpeechDat - Car , Aurora .
Professor B : Um , it was on the SpeechDat - Car .
PhD D : Yeah . So I tried a hundred to four K . Yeah .
Professor B : Um ,
PhD D : So it was {disfmarker}
Professor B : and on {disfmarker} and on the , um , um , {vocalsound} TI - digits also ?
PhD D : No , no , no . I think I just tried it on SpeechDat - Car .
Professor B : Mmm . That 'd be something to look at sometime because what , um , eh , he was looking at was performance in this room .
PhD D : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : Would that be more like {disfmarker} Well , you 'd think that 'd be more like SpeechDat - Car , I guess , in terms of the noise . The SpeechDat - Car is more , uh , sort of roughly stationary , a lot of it . And {disfmarker} and TI - digits maybe is not so much as {disfmarker}
PhD D : Yeah .
PhD C : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : Yeah .
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : Mm - hmm . OK . Well , maybe it 's not a big deal . But , um {disfmarker} Anyway , that was just something we wondered about . But , um , uh , certainly a lot of the noise , uh , is , uh , below a hundred hertz . Uh , the signal - to - noise ratio , you know , looks a fair amount better if you {disfmarker} if you high - pass filter it from this room .
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : But , um {disfmarker} but it 's still pretty noisy . Even {disfmarker} even for a hundred hertz up , it 's {disfmarker} it 's still fairly noisy . The signal - to - noise ratio is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is actually still pretty bad .
PhD C : Mm - hmm .
PhD A : Hmm .
Professor B : So , um , I mean , the main {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}
PhD A : So that 's on th that 's on the f the far field ones though , right ? Yeah .
Professor B : Yeah , that 's on the far field . Yeah , the near field 's pretty good .
PhD A : So wha what is , uh {disfmarker} what 's causing that ?
Professor B : Well , we got a {disfmarker} a video projector in here , uh , and , uh {disfmarker} which we keep on during every {disfmarker} every session we record ,
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor B : which , you know , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} w we were aware of
PhD A : Uh - huh .
Professor B : but {disfmarker} but we thought it wasn't a bad thing .
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor B : I mean , that 's a nice noise source . Uh , and there 's also the , uh {disfmarker} uh , air conditioning .
PhD A : Hmm .
Professor B : Which , uh , you know , is a pretty low frequency kind of thing .
PhD A : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : But {disfmarker} but , uh {disfmarker} So , those are {disfmarker} those are major components , I think ,
PhD A : I see .
Professor B : uh , for the stationary kind of stuff .
PhD A : Mmm .
Professor B : Um , but , um , it , uh {disfmarker} I guess , I {disfmarker} maybe I said this last week too but it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it really became apparent to us that we need to {disfmarker} to take account of noise . And , uh , so I think when {disfmarker} when he gets done with his prelim study I think {vocalsound} one of the next things we 'd want to do is to take this , uh {disfmarker} uh , noise , uh , processing stuff and {disfmarker} and , uh {disfmarker} uh , synthesize some speech from it .
PhD A : When are his prelims ?
Professor B : And then {disfmarker} Um , I think in about , um , a little less than two weeks .
PhD A : Oh . Wow .
Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . So . Uh , it might even be sooner . Uh , let 's see , this is the sixteenth , seventeenth ? Yeah , I don't know if he 's before {disfmarker} It might even be in a week .
PhD A : So , I
Professor B : A week ,
PhD A : Huh . I {disfmarker} I guessed that they were gonna do it some time during the semester
Professor B : week and a half .
PhD A : but they 'll do it any time , huh ?
Professor B : They seem to be {disfmarker} Well , the semester actually is starting up .
PhD A : Is it already ?
Professor B : Yeah , the semester 's late {disfmarker} late August they start here .
PhD A : Yikes .
Professor B : So they do it right at the beginning of the semester .
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor B : Yeah . So , uh {disfmarker} Yep . I mean , that {disfmarker} that was sort of one {disfmarker} I mean , the overall results seemed to be first place in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the case of either , um , artificial reverberation or a modest sized training set . Uh , either way , uh , i uh , it helped a lot . And {disfmarker} But if you had a {disfmarker} a really big training set , a recognizer , uh , system that was capable of taking advantage of a really large training set {disfmarker} I thought that {disfmarker} One thing with the HTK is that is has the {disfmarker} as we 're using {disfmarker} the configuration we 're using is w s is {disfmarker} being bound by the terms of Aurora , we have all those parameters just set as they are . So even if we had a hundred times as much data , we wouldn't go out to , you know , ten or t or a hundred times as many Gaussians or anything . So , um , it 's kind of hard to take advantage of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of big chunks of data . Uh , whereas the other one does sort of expand as you have more training data .
PhD C : Mm - hmm .
PhD D : Mmm , yeah .
Professor B : It does it automatically , actually . And so , um , uh , that one really benefited from the larger set . And it was also a diverse set with different noises and so forth . Uh , so , um , that , uh {disfmarker} that seemed to be {disfmarker} So , if you have that {disfmarker} that better recognizer that can {disfmarker} that can build up more parameters , and if you , um , have the natural room , which in this case has a p a pretty bad signal - to - noise ratio , then in that case , um , the right thing to do is just do {disfmarker} u use speaker adaptation . And {disfmarker} and not bother with {disfmarker} with this acoustic , uh , processing . But I think that that would not be true if we did some explicit noise - processing as well as , uh , the convolutional kind of things we were doing .
PhD C : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : So . That 's sort of what we found .
PhD D : Hmm .
PhD A : I , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , started working on the uh {disfmarker} Mississippi State recognizer . So , I got in touch with Joe and {disfmarker} and , uh , from your email and things like that .
PhD D : Oh , OK .
PhD A : And , uh , they added me to the list {disfmarker} uh , the mailing list .
PhD D : OK , great .
PhD A : And he gave me all of the pointers and everything that I needed . And so I downloaded the , um {disfmarker} There were two things , uh , that they had to download . One was the , uh , I guess the software . And another wad {disfmarker} was a , um , sort of like a sample {disfmarker} a sample run . So I downloaded the software and compiled all of that . And it compiled fine .
PhD D : Eight .
PhD A : No problems .
PhD D : Oh , eh , great .
PhD A : And , um , I grabbed the sample stuff but I haven't , uh , compiled it .
PhD D : That sample was released only yesterday or the day before , right ?
PhD A : No {disfmarker} Well , I haven't grabbed that one yet . So there 's two .
PhD D : Oh , there is another short sample set {disfmarker}
PhD A : There was another short one , yeah .
PhD D : o o sample .
PhD A : And so I haven't grabbed the latest one that he just , uh , put out yet .
PhD D : OK . Oh , OK . F Yeah , OK .
PhD A : So . Um , but , the software seemed to compile fine and everything , so . And , um , So .
Professor B : Is there any word yet about the issues about , um , adjustments for different feature sets or anything ?
PhD A : No , I {disfmarker} I d You asked me to write to him and I think I forgot to ask him about that . Or if I did ask him , he didn't reply .
Professor B : Yeah .
PhD A : I {disfmarker} I don't remember yet . Uh , I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll d I 'll double check that and ask him again .
Professor B : Yeah . Yeah , it 's like that {disfmarker} that could r turn out to be an important issue for us .
PhD D : Hmm . Mmm .
PhD A : Yeah . Yeah .
Professor B : Yeah .
PhD D : Cuz they have it {disfmarker}
PhD A : Maybe I 'll send it to the list . Yeah .
PhD D : Cuz they have , uh , already frozen those in i insertion penalties and all those stuff is what {disfmarker} I feel . Because they have this document explaining the recognizer .
PhD A : Uh - huh .
PhD D : And they have these tables with , uh , various language model weights , insertion penalties .
PhD A : OK , I haven't seen that one yet .
PhD D : u
PhD A : So .
PhD D : Uh , it 's th it 's there on that web .
PhD A : OK .
PhD D : And , uh , on that , I mean , they have run some experiments using various insertion penalties and all those {disfmarker}
PhD A : And so they 've picked {disfmarker} the values .
PhD D : Yeah , I think they pi p
PhD A : Oh , OK .
PhD D : yeah , they picked the values from {disfmarker}
PhD A : OK .
Professor B : For r w what test set ?
PhD D : Uh , p the one that they have reported is a NIST evaluation , Wall Street Journal .
Professor B : But that has nothing to do with what we 're testing on , right ?
PhD C : Mm - hmm .
PhD D : You know . No . So they 're , like {disfmarker} um {disfmarker} So they are actually trying to , uh , fix that {disfmarker} those values using the clean , uh , training part of the Wall Street Journal . Which is {disfmarker} I mean , the Aurora . Aurora has a clean subset .
Professor B : Right .
PhD D : I mean , they want to train it and then this {disfmarker} they 're going to run some evaluations .
Professor B : So they 're set they 're setting it based on that ?
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : OK . So now , we may come back to the situation where we may be looking for a modification of the features to account for the fact that we can't modify these parameters .
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor B : But , um ,
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : uh {disfmarker} but it 's still worth , I think , just {disfmarker} since {disfmarker} you know , just chatting with Joe about the issue .
PhD A : Yeah , OK . Do you think that 's something I should just send to him
Professor B : Um {disfmarker}
PhD A : or do you think I should send it to this {disfmarker} there 's an {disfmarker} a m a mailing list .
Professor B : Well , it 's not a secret . I mean , we 're , you know , certainly willing to talk about it with everybody , but I think {disfmarker} I think that , um {disfmarker} um , it 's probably best to start talking with him just to {disfmarker}
PhD A : OK .
Professor B : Uh @ @ {comment} you know , it 's a dialogue between two of you about what {disfmarker} you know , what does he think about this and what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} what could be done about it .
PhD A : Yeah . OK .
Professor B : Um , if you get ten people in {disfmarker} involved in it there 'll be a lot of perspectives based on , you know , how {disfmarker}
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor B : you know .
PhD A : Right .
Professor B : Uh {disfmarker} But , I mean , I think it all should come up eventually ,
PhD A : OK .
Professor B : but if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if there is any , uh , uh , way to move in {disfmarker} a way that would {disfmarker} that would , you know , be more open to different kinds of features . But if {disfmarker} if , uh {disfmarker} if there isn't , and it 's just kind of shut down and {disfmarker} and then also there 's probably not worthwhile bringing it into a larger forum where {disfmarker} where political issues will come in .
PhD A : Yeah . OK .
PhD D : Oh . So this is now {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's compiled under Solaris ?
PhD A : Yeah .
PhD D : Yeah , OK .
PhD A : Yep .
PhD D : Because he {disfmarker} there was some mail r saying that it 's {disfmarker} may not be stable for Linux and all those .
PhD A : Yeah . Yeah , i that was a particular version .
PhD D : SUSI
PhD A : Yeah , SUSI or whatever it was
PhD D : yeah . Yeah , yeah .
PhD A : but we don't have that .
PhD D : Yeah , OK .
PhD A : So . Should be OK .
PhD D : OK , that 's fine .
PhD A : Yeah , it compiled fine actually .
PhD D : Yeah .
PhD A : No {disfmarker} no errors . Nothing . So .
Professor B : Uh , this is slightly off topic
PhD D : That 's good .
Professor B : but , uh , I noticed , just glancing at the , uh , Hopkins workshop , uh , web site that , uh , um {disfmarker} one of the thing I don't know {disfmarker} Well , we 'll see how much they accomplish , but one of the things that they were trying to do in the graphical models thing was to put together a {disfmarker} a , uh , tool kit for doing , uh r um , arbitrary graphical models for , uh , speech recognition .
PhD A : Hmm .
Professor B : So {disfmarker} And Jeff , uh {disfmarker} the two Jeffs were
PhD A : Who 's the second Jeff ?
Professor B : Uh {disfmarker} Oh , uh , do you know Geoff Zweig ?
PhD A : No .
Professor B : Oh . Uh , he {disfmarker} he , uh {disfmarker} he was here for a couple years
PhD A : Oh , OK .
Professor B : and he , uh {disfmarker} got his PHD . He {disfmarker} And he 's , uh , been at IBM for the last couple years .
PhD A : Oh , OK .
Professor B : So .
PhD A : Wow . That would be neat .
Professor B : Uh , so he did {disfmarker} he did his PHD on dynamic Bayes - nets , uh , for {disfmarker} for speech recognition . He had some continuity built into the model , presumably to handle some , um , inertia in the {disfmarker} in the production system , and , um {disfmarker}
PhD A : Hmm .
Professor B : So .
PhD D : Hmm .
PhD C : Um , I 've been playing with , first , the , um , VAD . Um , {vocalsound} so it 's exactly the same approach , but the features that the VAD neural network use are , uh , MFCC after noise compensation . Oh , I think I have the results .
Professor B : What was it using before ?
PhD C : Before it was just P L
PhD D : 
PhD C : So .
PhD D : Yeah , it was actually {disfmarker} No . Not {disfmarker} I mean , it was just the noisy features I guess .
PhD C : Yeah ,
PhD D : Yeah , yeah , yeah ,
PhD C : noisy {disfmarker} noisy features .
PhD D : not compensated .
PhD C : Um {disfmarker} This is what we get after {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} So , actually , we , yeah , here the features are noise compensated and there is also the LDA filter . Um , and then it 's a pretty small neural network which use , um , {vocalsound} nine frames of {disfmarker} of six features from C - zero to C - fives , plus the first derivatives . And it has one hundred hidden units .
PhD A : Is that nine frames u s uh , centered around the current frame ? Or {disfmarker}
PhD C : Yeah . Mm - hmm .
Professor B : S so , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sorry , there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's how many {disfmarker} how many inputs ?
PhD C : So it 's twelve times nine .
Professor B : Twelve times nine inputs , and a hundred , uh , hidden .
PhD C : Hidden and
PhD D : Two outputs .
PhD C : two outputs .
Professor B : Two outputs . OK . So I guess about eleven thousand parameters , which {disfmarker} actually shouldn't be a problem , even in {disfmarker} in small phones . Yeah .
PhD C : Mm - hmm .
PhD A : So , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} s so what is different between this and {disfmarker} and what you {disfmarker}
PhD C : It should be OK . So the previous syst It 's based on the system that has a fifty - three point sixty - six percent improvement . It 's the same system . The only thing that changed is the n a p eh {disfmarker} a es the estimation of the silence probabilities .
PhD A : Ah . OK .
PhD C : Which now is based on , uh , cleaned features .
Professor B : And , it 's a l it 's a lot better .
PhD A : Wow .
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor B : That 's great .
PhD C : Um {disfmarker} So it 's {disfmarker} it 's not bad , but the problem is still that the latency is too large .
Professor B : What 's the latency ?
PhD C : Because {disfmarker} um {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the latency of the VAD is two hundred and twenty milliseconds . And , uh , the VAD is used uh , i for on - line normalization , and it 's used before the delta computation . So if you add these components it goes t to a hundred and seventy , right ?
Professor B : I {disfmarker} I 'm confused . You started off with two - twenty and you ended up with one - seventy ?
PhD C : With two an two hundred and seventy .
Professor B : Two - seventy .
PhD C : If {disfmarker} Yeah , if you add the c delta comp delta computation
Professor B : Oh .
PhD C : which is done afterwards . Um {disfmarker}
Professor B : So it 's two - twenty . I the is this {disfmarker} are these twenty - millisecond frames ? Is that why ? Is it after downsampling ? or {disfmarker}
PhD C : The two - twenty is one hundred milliseconds for the um {disfmarker} No , it 's forty milliseconds for t for the , uh , uh , cleaning of the speech . Um {disfmarker} then there is , um , the neural network which use nine frames . So it adds forty milliseconds .
Professor B : a OK .
PhD C : Um , after that , um , you have the um , filtering of the silence probabilities . Which is a million filter it , and it creates a one hundred milliseconds delay . So , um {disfmarker}
Professor B : 
PhD D : Plus there is a delta at the input .
PhD C : Yeah , and there is the delta at the input which is ,
Professor B : One hundred milliseconds for smoothing .
PhD C : um {disfmarker} So it 's {disfmarker} @ @ {disfmarker}
Professor B : Uh , median .
PhD C : 
PhD D : It 's like forty plus {disfmarker} forty {disfmarker} plus {disfmarker}
Professor B : And then forty {disfmarker}
PhD C : Mmm . Forty {disfmarker} This forty plus twenty , plus one hundred .
Professor B : forty p 
PhD C : Uh {disfmarker}
PhD D : So it 's two hundred actually .
PhD C : Yeah , there are twenty that comes from {disfmarker} There is ten that comes from the LDA filters also . Right ?
PhD D : Oh , OK .
PhD C : Uh , so it 's two hundred and ten , yeah .
PhD D : If you are using {disfmarker}
Professor B : Uh {disfmarker}
PhD C : Plus the frame ,
PhD D : t If you are using three frames {disfmarker}
PhD C : so it 's two - twenty .
PhD D : If you are phrasing f {comment} using three frames , it is thirty here for delta .
PhD C : Yeah , I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's five frames , but .
PhD D : So five frames , that 's twenty . OK , so it 's who un {comment} two hundred and ten .
Professor B : Uh , p Wait a minute . It 's forty {disfmarker} {vocalsound} forty for the {disfmarker} for the cleaning of the speech ,
PhD C : So . Forty cleaning .
Professor B : forty for the I N {disfmarker} ANN , a hundred for the smoothing .
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor B : Well , but at ten {disfmarker} ,
PhD C : Twenty for the delta .
Professor B : Twenty for delta .
PhD D : At th {nonvocalsound} At the input . I mean , that 's at the input to the net .
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor B : Delta at input to net ?
PhD D : And there i
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD D : Yeah . So it 's like s five , six cepstrum plus delta at nine {disfmarker} nine frames of {disfmarker}
Professor B : And then ten milliseconds for {disfmarker}
PhD D : Fi - There 's an LDA filter .
Professor B : ten milliseconds for LDA filter , and t and ten {disfmarker} another ten milliseconds you said for the frame ?
PhD C : For the frame I guess . I computed two - twenty {disfmarker} Yeah , well , it 's {disfmarker} I guess it 's for the fr {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}
Professor B : OK . And then there 's delta besides that ?
PhD C : So this is the features that are used by our network and then afterwards , you have to compute the delta on the , uh , main feature stream ,
Professor B : OK .
PhD C : which is um , delta and double - deltas , which is fifty milliseconds .
Professor B : Yeah . No , I mean , the {disfmarker} after the noise part , the forty {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the other hundred and eighty {disfmarker} Well , I mean , Wait a minute . Some of this is , uh {disfmarker} is , uh {disfmarker} is in parallel , isn't it ? I mean , the LDA {disfmarker} Oh , you have the LDA as part of the V D - uh , VAD ? Or {disfmarker}
PhD C : The VAD use , uh , LDA filtered features also .
Professor B : Oh , it does ?
PhD C : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : Ah . So in that case there isn't too much in parallel . Uh {disfmarker}
PhD C : No . There is , um , just downsampling , upsampling , and the LDA .
Professor B : Um , so the delta at the end is how much ?
PhD C : It 's fifty .
PhD D : It 's {disfmarker}
Professor B : Fifty . Alright . So {disfmarker}
PhD C : But well , we could probably put the delta , um , {vocalsound} before on - line normalization . It should not that make a big difference ,
PhD A : What if you used a smaller window for the delta ?
PhD C : because {disfmarker}
PhD A : Could that help a little bit ? I mean , I guess there 's a lot of things you could do to {disfmarker}
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor B : Yeah .
PhD C : Yeah ,
Professor B : So
PhD C : but , nnn {disfmarker}
Professor B : Yeah . So if you {disfmarker} if you put the delta before the , uh , ana on - line {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} Yeah {disfmarker}
PhD C : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : uh {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} then it could go in parallel .
PhD C : Cuz i
Professor B : And then y then you don't have that additive {disfmarker}
PhD C : Yeah ,
PhD D : Yep .
PhD C : cuz the time constant of the on - line normalization is pretty long compared to the delta window ,
Professor B : OK .
PhD C : so . It should not make {disfmarker}
Professor B : OK . And you ought to be able to shove tw , uh {disfmarker} sh uh {disfmarker} pull off twenty milliseconds from somewhere else to get it under two hundred , right ? I mean {disfmarker}
PhD A : Is two hundred the d
Professor B : The hundred milla
PhD C : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : mill a hundred milliseconds for smoothing is sort of an arbitrary amount . It could be eighty and {disfmarker} and probably do @ @ {disfmarker}
PhD C : Yeah ,
PhD A : i a hun
PhD C : yeah .
PhD A : uh {disfmarker} Wh - what 's the baseline you need to be under ? Two hundred ?
Professor B : Well , we don't know . They 're still arguing about it .
PhD C : 
PhD A : Oh .
Professor B : I mean , if it 's two {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if it 's , uh {disfmarker} if it 's two - fifty , then we could keep the delta where it is if we shaved off twenty . If it 's two hundred , if we shaved off twenty , we could {disfmarker} we could , uh , meet it by moving the delta back .
PhD A : So , how do you know that what you have is too much if they 're still deciding ?
Professor B : Uh , we don't , but it 's just {disfmarker} I mean , the main thing is that since that we got burned last time , and {disfmarker} you know , by not worrying about it very much , we 're just staying conscious of it .
PhD A : Uh - huh . Oh , OK , I see .
Professor B : And so , th I mean , if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if a week before we have to be done someone says , "" Well , you have to have fifty milliseconds less than you have now "" , it would be pretty frantic around here . So {disfmarker}
PhD A : Ah , OK .
Professor B : Uh {disfmarker}
PhD A : But still , that 's {disfmarker} that 's a pretty big , uh , win . And it doesn't seem like you 're {disfmarker} in terms of your delay , you 're , uh , that {disfmarker}
Professor B : He added a bit on , I guess , because before we were {disfmarker} we were {disfmarker} had {disfmarker} were able to have the noise , uh , stuff , uh , and the LVA be in parallel .
PhD C : Hmm .
Professor B : And now he 's {disfmarker} he 's requiring it to be done first .
PhD C : Well , but I think the main thing , maybe , is the cleaning of the speech , which takes forty milliseconds or so .
Professor B : Right . Well , so you say {disfmarker} let 's say ten milliseconds {disfmarker} seconds for the LDA .
PhD C : And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} the LDA is , well , pretty short right now .
Professor B : Well , ten . And then forty for the other .
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD D : Yeah , the LDA {disfmarker} LDA {disfmarker} we don't know , is , like {disfmarker} is it very crucial for the features , right ?
PhD C : No . I just {disfmarker} This is the first try .
PhD D : Yeah .
Professor B : Right ,
PhD C : I mean , I {disfmarker} maybe the LDA 's not very useful then .
Professor B : so you could start pulling back ,
PhD D : S s h
Professor B : but {disfmarker}
PhD D : Yeah ,
Professor B : But I think you have {disfmarker}
PhD D : l
Professor B : I mean , you have twenty for delta computation which y now you 're sort of doing twice , right ? But yo w were you doing that before ?
PhD C : Mmm . Well , in the proposal , um , the input of the VAD network were just three frames , I think .
PhD D : On the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . Just {disfmarker} Yeah , just the static , no delta .
Professor B : Right .
PhD C : Uh , static features .
Professor B : So , what you have now is fort uh , forty for the {disfmarker} the noise , twenty for the delta , and ten for the LDA . That 's seventy milliseconds of stuff which was formerly in parallel ,
PhD C : 
Professor B : right ? So I think ,
PhD C : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : you know , that 's {disfmarker} that 's the difference as far as the timing , right ?
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor B : Um , and you could experiment with cutting various pieces of these back a bit , but {disfmarker} I mean , we 're s we 're not {disfmarker} we 're not in terrible shape .
PhD A : Yeah , that 's what it seems like to me . It 's pretty good .
Professor B : Yeah .
PhD C : Mm - hmm .
Professor B : It 's {disfmarker} it 's not like it 's adding up to four hundred milliseconds or something .
PhD A : Where {disfmarker} where is this {disfmarker} where is this fifty - seven point O two in {disfmarker} in comparison to the last evaluation ?
Professor B : Well , it 's {disfmarker} I think it 's better than anything , uh , anybody got .
PhD A : Oh , is that right ?
PhD C : Yeah . The best was fifty - four point five .
Professor B : Yeah .
PhD D : Point s
PhD A : Oh .
Professor B : Yeah . Uh
PhD C : And our system was forty - nine , but with the neural network .
PhD A : Wow . So this is almost ten percent .
Professor B : With the f with the neural net . Yeah , and r and {disfmarker}
PhD C : It would
PhD D : Yeah , so this is {disfmarker} this is like the first proposal . The proposal - one . It was forty - four , actually .
Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . And we still don't have the neural net in . So {disfmarker} so it 's {disfmarker}
PhD A : Wow .
Professor B : You know . So it 's {disfmarker} We 're {disfmarker} we 're doing better .
PhD A : This is {disfmarker} this is really good .
Professor B : I mean , we 're getting better recognition . I mean , I 'm sure other people working on this are not sitting still either , but {disfmarker}
PhD A : Yeah .
Professor B : but {disfmarker} but , uh {disfmarker} Uh , I mean , the important thing is that we learn how to do this better , and , you know . So . Um , Yeah . So , our , um {disfmarker} Yeah , you can see the kind of {disfmarker} kind of numbers that we 're having , say , on SpeechDat - Car which is a hard task , cuz it 's really , um {disfmarker} I think it 's just sort of {disfmarker} sort of reasonable numbers , starting to be . I mean , it 's still terri
PhD C : Mm - hmm . Yeah , even for a well - matched case it 's sixty percent error rate reduction ,
Professor B : Yeah .
PhD C : which is {disfmarker}
Professor B : Yeah . Probably half . Good !
PhD C : Um , Yeah . So actually , this is in between {vocalsound} what we had with the previous VAD and what Sunil did with an IDL VAD . Which gave sixty - two percent improvement , right ?
PhD D : Yeah , it 's almost that .
PhD C : So {disfmarker}
PhD D : It 's almost an average somewhere around {disfmarker}
PhD C : Yeah .
PhD D : Yeah .
PhD A : What was that ? Say that last part again ?
PhD C : So , if you use , like , an IDL VAD , uh , for dropping the frames ,
PhD D : o o Or the best we can get .
PhD C : the best that we can get {disfmarker} i That means that we estimate the silence probability on the clean version of the utterances . Then you can go up to sixty - two percent error rate reduction , globally .
PhD A : Mmm .
PhD C : Mmm {disfmarker} Yeah .
PhD A : So that would be even {disfmarker} That wouldn't change this number down here to sixty - two ?
PhD C : Yeah .
Professor B : Yeah . So you {disfmarker} you were get
PhD C : If you add a g good v very good VAD , that works as well as a VAD working on clean speech ,

"The Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)) : I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the sixth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 pandemic. Today's meeting is taking place by videoconference. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. When you are ready to speak, please activate your mic. When you are not speaking, leave your mic on mute. Of course, change the language when you change the language on the screen.  I would remind hon. members that if you want to speak English, you should be on the English channel; if you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel; and should you wish to alternate between the two languages, as I just did, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking, each time you switch languages. In addition, please direct your remarks through the chair and speak slowly and clearly at all times to help our interpreters. Finally, for members who will be speaking, we strongly recommend that you use a headset. I recommend the headset for your fellow members, but also for the interpreters as it gets loud, up and down, and it squeaks. It really does make it difficult for them if you do not have the prescribed headsets. We'll go on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we will proceed to presenting petitions, for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. We will now proceed to presenting petitions.
Ms. Heather McPherson (Edmonton Strathcona, NDP) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. World Maternal Mental Health Day took place last week, and today I'd like to take a moment to present a very important petition on behalf of the Canadian Perinatal Mental Health Collaborative. Whereas perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are the most common obstetrical complication, whereas in Canada and worldwide 20% of women and 10% of men suffer from a perinatal mental illness, resulting in an annual economic cost to Canada of approximately $11 billion, and whereas the U.K., Australia and parts of the U.S. have perinatal mental health strategies and screening guidelines in place and Canada does not, the Canadian Perinatal Mental Health Collaborative is calling upon the House of Commons in Parliament assembled to create a national perinatal mental health strategy that will provide direction, policy and funding to develop specialized, comprehensive perinatal mental health care services, which include universal screening and timely access to treatment for all women and men during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
Mr. Scott Reid (LanarkFrontenacKingston, CPC) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. My petition relates to cystic fibrosis. If we were in the House now, as May is Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month, one of the days this month we would all be wearing yellow roses in sympathy and solidarity with those who suffer from what is the number one disease killer in Canada of young people. The petitioners have asked us to look at the situation with the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, which is scheduled to go through some important and potentially detrimental regulatory changes very soon. They ask that the amendments to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board be rescinded, as these will restrict Canadians from receiving life-saving medications for cystic fibrosis and other illnesses, but in particular, a medicine called Trikafta, which can have the effect of treating cystic fibrosis in the case of 90% of cystic fibrosis sufferers. They ask the government to work with the provinces to find a strategy to jointly allow for the delivery of this life-saving medicine to Canadians across the country and to take a leadership role in negotiating a price for gene modulators throughout all the provinces of Canada.
Ms. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's an honour to take the mike today, with all colleagues here. It's good to see you all virtually and safe. Petitioners in my community point out in this petition, which, of course, predates the pandemic, that the family doctor shortage is severe in this country. Nearly five million Canadians lack a regular family doctor. This problem is particularly profound in more rural areas, including, as the petitioners reference, the community in which I live, Sydney, British Columbia. We have a very significant crisis and a lack of family doctors. The petitioners call on the government to work with provinces and territories to find a collaborative, holistic solution so that every Canadian has a family doctor and we address the family doctor shortage.
Mr. Brad Vis (MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, CPC) : Good morning, Mr. Chair. I'm presenting a timely petition today that emphasizes the concerns constituents in my riding of MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon have with the Liberal government's inherently flawed and undemocratic approach to firearms legislation and regulation. The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed RCMP-vetted Canadians; to focus taxpayer dollars where they will actually increase public safety, which is on keeping at-risk youth from being involved in gangs and on anti-gang enforcement; and to provide our men and women in uniform at the Canada Border Services Agency with the resources they need to stop the flow of illegal guns into this country. Through this petition, my constituents take issue with how the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal weapons smugglers responsible for the violence in our communities. They note that the use of the phrase military-style assault rifle is purely political posturing, as the term is undefined in Canadian law. They also draw attention to the numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation
The Chair : I'd like to remind the honourable members that this is a concise prcis of what a petition says, not a speech. I'll let Mr. Vis continue. I'm sure he'll be very brief in wrapping up.
Mr. Brad Vis : Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. That's sufficient.
The Chair : Okay. Now we'll go to Mr. Johns.
Mr. Gord Johns (CourtenayAlberni, NDP) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's a huge honour to table e-petition 2512, which was signed by 1,198 petitioners, primarily from the province of Nova Scotia. The Province of Nova Scotia invited multinational companies to scope out and develop expansive open-net salmon farming operations. The petitioners cite that the expansion would increase environmental degradation, as seen in similar aquaculture operations in British Columbia, Newfoundland, Norway, Vietnam and elsewhere in the world. It also, they cite, would pose risks to native fish stocks, pollute coastal ecosystems, impair at-risk wild Atlantic salmon, and threaten established fisheries and tourism operations. They also raise concerns that open-net fish farming would not create significant employment and would undermine existing lobster and other fisheries. They are calling on the government to uphold Bill C-68 and species-at-risk legislation, protect our oceans, ban expansion of open-net finfish aquaculture in our oceans, work to phase out any existing open-net fish farming operations currently in place and, lastly, invest in land-based, closed-containment finfish aquaculture. I want to thank these petitioners for fighting for clean oceans, for their local economy and for the well-being of Nova Scotia.
Mr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. This petition was signed and sent in by constituents of my riding of NanaimoLadysmith. It calls upon the House of Commons to commit to upholding the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by immediately halting all existing and planned construction of the Coastal GasLink project on Wet'suwet'en territory, ordering the RCMP to dismantle its exclusion zone and stand down, scheduling nation-to-nation talks between the Wet'suwet'en nation and the federal and provincial governmentssomething that has already happened, thankfullyand prioritizing the real implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
Ms. Yasmin Ratansi (Don Valley East, Lib.) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have the pleasure of presenting a petition on behalf of my constituents of Don Valley East. The petitioners are asking that the Government of Canada not provide any financial assistance to Canadian airlines until they promptly provide full refunds for flights that were cancelled due to COVID-19. They are asking the same for any foreign airlines that fly to, within or from Canada. The petitioners feel that these Canadians are facing economic hardship and need a refund.
The Chair : We'll now proceed to questioning ministers. The first question will go to Mr. Albas.
Mr. Dan Albas (Central OkanaganSimilkameenNicola, CPC) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. Today we've learned that federal workers have been told to ignore obvious signs of fraud when it comes to applying for government benefits. Can the Prime Minister confirm that 200,000 applications have been flagged as potentially fraudulent?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. Our priority from the beginning has been to make sure that Canadians get the support they need. We moved very quickly to get the Canada emergency response benefit out, to get the wage subsidy out and to help Canadians in this unprecedented situation. We recognize there will be challenges, and we are going to work through those challenges. Our priority every step of the way was to make sure we helped as many Canadians as possible.
Mr. Dan Albas : Mr. Chair, can the Prime Minister confirm that the instruction has been given to federal employees to ignore these 200,000 applications being flagged as potentially fraudulent? This is important.
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Our focus has been on helping as many people as we possible can. Our decision from the very beginning was to get the help out to people and figure out, with retroactive action if necessary, where and when there may have been fraudulent use. Our priority was getting that help out.
Mr. Dan Albas : Mr. Chair, this came from a memo issued by a deputy minister. Did the minister's office or the Prime Minister sign off on this memo?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Again, in this unprecedented situation, our focus has been on helping as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. Other parties might have made a different choice had they been in government, but our focus was getting help to people when they needed it as quickly as possible and cleaning it up afterwards.
Mr. Dan Albas : Mr. Chair, I asked a very simple question. Did the Prime Minister or his minister sign off on this memo that was issued by the deputy minister, yes or no?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, we have been focused entirely on getting help to Canadians when they need it, and that has meant that yes, there will be things we will need to clean up after the fact and work to fix, but getting that help into Canadians' pockets during this pandemic was our priority.
Mr. Dan Albas : I'm asking the Prime Minister to show some accountability. Did he or his office sign off on this memo?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, my office and I have been absolutely focused on getting the necessary help to Canadians. Perhaps, as Mr. Albas points out, other parties would have been slower to get the money out. We were flowing money to people who needed it.
Mr. Dan Albas : Mr. Chair, the question was quite simple. Obviously the Prime Minister doesn't seem comfortable with the answer. Will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud, or will he write them off, as the story said?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, in this unprecedented situation Canadians have lost their jobs; they've lost their paycheques; they don't know how they're going to be able to support their loved ones and pay for their groceries. We made a decision as a country that we would be there for them and that has been and will continue to be our priority.
Mr. Dan Albas : Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister can leave the cottage talk for the cottage. We're asking a very simple question here. Will he commit as a government to enforce the rule of law and to enforce the attestation that says that if someone commits fraud, the fraud will be pursued?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : My commitment as Prime Minister and as a government is to support and protect Canadians. That is what we are doing by giving them the support they need through this unprecedented situation. Perhaps other parties don't think it's important to support Canadians. We will keep focused on supporting Canadians.
Mr. Dan Albas : That's not what I'm asking here, Mr. Chair. The Conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through. What we are asking about is fraud. All along we've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact, and we expect that to happen. Can the Prime Minister at least confirm that this will happen?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : When we made the determination that we needed to move quickly to help Canadians, we knew there would be a need to clean up after the fact, to go after fraudulent cases. We will do that. Our priority now and in the coming months is to ensure Canadians get the support they need, and our economy comes roaring back. That's what we're focused on.
The Chair : We'll now continue with Mr.Ste-Marie.
Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie (Joliette, BQ) : Mr.Chair, yesterday, the Prime Minister announced the large employer emergency financing facility. That's good. What's even better is that he announced that the loans would be tied to conditions. One of those conditions forces companies not to resort to tax evasion or tax avoidance through tax havens. Excellent! Unfortunately, I quickly became disillusioned because it is more about abusive tax evasion and avoidance. Basically, we're talking about fraudsters. There are no conditions that would allow us to tighten the screws on profiteers. Companies that legally take advantage of tax havens to avoid paying their taxes will have access to the large employer emergency financing facility. Why does the Prime Minister continue to support the profiteers?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair, we will always be there to counter tax evasion and tax avoidance. It's a priority of our government. There is no tolerance for tax evasion and tax avoidance. In the current situation, our priority is to help workers across the country who could lose their jobs or who have lost their jobs. That's why we are introducing measures that support workers, who will continue to be our priority.
Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie : Mr.Chair, I'm delighted to hear the Prime Minister say that there's no tolerance for tax avoidance. The problem is that his remarks don't reflect reality. Tax avoidance is the legal use of tax havens. The five big Bay Street banks benefit from this, as do the big multinationals. It's time to tighten the screws on these companies. They have to pay their share. Will the Prime Minister and his government outlaw what is immoral?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair, when we announced the large employer emergency funding facility, we recognized that those who wanted to receive tax dollars had to have paid their fair share of taxes. That's why we're putting in place measures to carefully assess the tax structures of these businesses before we loan money to them.
Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie : Mr.Chair, sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in Canada and register them in a subsidiary in the Bahamas, Barbados or another tax haven. Does the Prime Minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in Canada?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair, we will assess applications for the large employer emergency funding facility on a case-by-case basis. We don't expect the big banks to need these funds. Before we provide any money, we're going to make sure that whoever wants to access these funds is transparent about how the money is being managed, including internationally.
Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie : Mr.Chair, I'll change the subject now. Consumers are paying more and more with their credit cards, which allows contactless payments in shops, not to mention online shopping. This benefits Visa and Mastercard, which charge appallingly high user fees, known as interchange fees. These are almost 10times higher than in Europe and Australia, and it costs our merchants a fortune. Can the Prime Minister follow the example of Europe and Australia by capping interchange fees at0.3%?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair, we are always looking for ways to reduce costs for consumers. We have worked with the big banks and the financial industry to ensure that people who need it have access to the help they need. We're reassessing how we can lower costs for consumers. Right now, we're sending money to consumers across the country who need it to get through this crisis. That's what we'll continue to focus on.
Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie : Mr.Chair, the question doesn't concern consumers, but merchants. A credit card company, such as Visa and Mastercard, that charges a fee of 2.5%to3% per transaction undermines the merchant's profit margin and gets richer at the expense of consumers. I invite the Prime Minister to follow the example of Europe and Australia by capping these fees at0.3%.
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair, we continue to work with financial institutions and the big banks to help consumers during this exceptional and difficult situation. Of course, there are some things we can look at over the longer term as well.
The Chair : We'll now go to Ms. Kwan.
Ms. Jenny Kwan (Vancouver East, NDP) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. Instead of providing a universal direct payment for all, the government has decided to implement a complicated program that leaves many people behind. A single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to COVID-19. She pays taxes on her spousal income, but she is not eligible for CERB. The Minister of Employment said that she is looking into this gap. It has been weeks, and still no action. Will the Prime Minister step in and fix this gap so that the single parents and their children can get the support they need during this pandemic?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : I'm happy, Mr. Chair, to correct the honourable member by pointing out that we actually moved in the most rapid and simplest possible way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of Canadians who needed it through the Canada emergency response benefit. However, as the member points out, when one moves quickly and efficiently, there will be gaps, and that's why we've been working diligently to try to fill those gaps. We want to make sure that Canadians who need help, get it.
Ms. Jenny Kwan : While the Minister of Employment has been aware of this for three weeks and says she is looking into it, there's still been no action. The truth of the matter is that single parents and their children who depend on spousal support and child maintenance are not getting support. Will the Prime Minister fix this gap?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : We recognize the particular challenge faced by families, single parents and families with young children, which is why we increased the amount of the Canada child benefit to be able to support people in this particular moment. On top of that, we have looked to fill further gaps that have existed with the Canada emergency response benefit. Well over seven million Canadians have access to CERB, and we will continue to work with them
Ms. Jenny Kwan : That does not replace spousal support and child maintenance, Prime Minister. Across the country there is no national standard to address the homelessness crisis amidst this pandemic, leaving communities at heightened risk from COVID-19. Canadians who are homeless or living in substandard housing have no access to bathroom facilities for basic hygiene. Those living in crowded SROs and shelters cannot practise social distancing. The problem is particularly acute in my riding in the Downtown Eastside. While the B.C. government has implemented an initiative to house some of the homeless population in empty hotels in the short term, support from the federal government is needed to secure permanent solutions post-COVID-19. Will the Prime Minister commit to providing matching funds and take the right to adequate housing seriously?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : I know that the honourable member wouldn't want to inadvertently mislead the House. The fact is, the federal government almost immediately sent significant resources, hundreds of millions of dollars, to shelters across the country to enable them to create facilities, including renting new spaces, to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of COVID-19. I recognize there's always more to do, but as we demonstrated with our national housing strategy, we are serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable Canadians, and we will continue to do that.
Ms. Jenny Kwan : The Prime Minister must know that the money the federal government sent is deficient. Many people still remain homeless, and they are at risk. Cutting chronic homelessness by 50% over the next decade is not good enough, and that is this Prime Minister's national housing strategy. Will the government stop just making empty promises and ensure that every Canadian has the right to housing? Will he top up the support for provinces to at least match their funds?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, cutting chronic homelessness by 50% is an ambitious goal that no one else has ever been able to do as a government, and we are well on track for it. I would suggest that the member opposite not dismiss that as an empty promise, because we have demonstrated actions on it. I recognize there is more to do. There is always more to do. We will be there and continue to be there for vulnerable people, including homeless Canadians.
Ms. Jenny Kwan : I would remind the Prime Minister that it was the federal Liberals who eliminated the national affordable housing program in 1993, so we have this homeless crisis today as a result of the Liberals. We in Vancouver East have the third-largest urban indigenous population in the country, yet we got less than 2% of the pandemic urban indigenous housing funding. They're overrepresented among the homeless population. Why?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, we recognize there is more to do in supporting urban indigenous people. We have moved forward, both through the Minister of Indigenous Services and the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, to address the challenges facing urban aboriginal populations. We will continue to work with them, recognizing that they are among the most vulnerable people in Canada who deserve the right support from all orders of government, and we will be there to support them increasingly in the coming years.
The Chair : Ms. Bergen.
Hon. Candice Bergen (PortageLisgar, CPC) : Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, I'm hearing in my riding of PortageLisgar that individuals who are dealing with Service Canada through the mail are experiencing delays. It seems that the mail that's going to Service Canada has not been opened. In fact, one of my constituents sent documents, including a doctor's note, two months ago on March 12 and is now being told that she must resend them because they've never been opened. Can the government tell us whether this is a widespread problem, and how are they dealing with unopened mail at Service Canada?
The Chair : The honourable minister.
Hon. Ahmed Hussen (Minister of Families, Children and Social Development) : Mr. Chair, I want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in Service Canada to meet the expectations of Canadians. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had unprecedented volumes, but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means. We had to close a number of the centres because of COVID-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of Canadians.
Hon. Candice Bergen : Is the minister aware whether this is a widespread problem? Is this happening rarely, or frequently? I'm hearing about it. I know, from many MPs, we are at the front lines of dealing with and helping constituents who are not only wanting to get support but also are trying to get programs unrelated to COVID-19. Is unopened mail a widespread problem at Service Canada?
Hon. Ahmed Hussen : Mr. Chair, I'm happy to look into the particular case that the honourable member brings up. I am not aware of unopened mail being a widespread issue. I'm happy to work with the honourable member to see what happened in this individual case.
Hon. Candice Bergen : Thanks very much. Mr. Chair, the Iver Johnson single-shot rifle is a standard farm gun used by many farmers in my riding, in fact, passed down from generation to generation in some cases. Why are the Liberals making this gun illegal? What's the purpose of banning this particular farm rifle?
The Chair : The honourable minister.
Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) : Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I just wish to advise the member that we worked very closely with the Canadian firearms program, with law enforcement and with their firearms verification to identify the makes, models and variants of nine rifles, all of which had in their earliest provenance a design for military use, for soldiers to use in combat. Those are the weapons that have been
The Chair : We'll now go back to Ms. Bergen.
Hon. Candice Bergen : I would challenge the minister on that. I do not believe that he has been consulting with front-line officers. We're hearing from front-line officers that they are concerned about gangs, drug dealers and illegal weapons being smuggled across the border. They are not concerned with these types of farm rifles that are being used by our farmers and, in some cases, hunters. These are specifically used for hunting. So, Mr. Chair, we'd like to see the evidence on why the Liberals are once again targeting law-abiding Canadians, ignoring gangsters and drug dealers. Why are they banning the Iver Johnson?
Hon. Bill Blair : It's a great opportunity, I think, when the member opposite says what the police are saying. Let's hear what the police are saying. The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police declared that military assault rifles were produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and urged the government to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles, except for law enforcement and military purposes. The Ontario police leaders said that they support a prohibition on all military-designed rifles. They said, In our view, these weapons have no place in our communities and should be reserved for use by Canada's military and law enforcement.
The Chair : Ms. Bergen, we have about 50 seconds left.
Hon. Candice Bergen : Mr. Chair, we've seen this before, where the Liberals introduced a long-gun registry that cost billions of dollars and did absolutely nothing to stop violent crimes. This is a repeat of what the Liberals have done before. Is the minister saying that the Iver Johnson that farmers use is an assault rifle?
Hon. Bill Blair : Actually, what I'm saying, and what our regulations say very clearly, is that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers have no place in Canadian society. I would also advise the member that any Canadian killed by gun violence is one too many. We have far too many tragedies where these types of weapons have been used to kill Canadians.
The Chair : We'll now continue with Mr.Rayes.
Mr. Alain Rayes (RichmondArthabaska, CPC) : Thank you, Mr.Chair. My question is for the Prime Minister. Is it true that Canada Revenue Agency employees who process applications for the Canada emergency response benefit, or CERB, have been asked to send the payment even if fraud had been detected, as was pointed out in a national media report today?
Hon. Diane Lebouthillier (Minister of National Revenue) : Mr.Chair, our government considers these to be very difficult times for Canadians. We're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries. I'm very proud of the public servants who work at the Canada Revenue Agency. Nearly sevenmillion
Mr. Alain Rayes : I repeat my question, which is extremely simple: Is it true that the Canada Revenue Agency sent a memo to its employees asking them to ignore the fraudsters and still send the CERB payments??
Hon. Diane Lebouthillier : I'll finish my response, which was interrupted: Nearly 7.8million Canadians have applied for the Canada emergency response benefit. The priority is for Canadians to be able to pay for their groceries and their housing.
Mr. Alain Rayes : Yes or no: Did the Canada Revenue Agency send a memo to its employeeswho are doing an exceptional job, I'd like to point outso that they would ignore the 200,000potential cases of fraud that they detected?
Hon. Diane Lebouthillier : The answer is no.
Mr. Alain Rayes : The CERB has been distributed since March25, so for seven weeks now. The federal government website clearly states that if an employee returns to work, the employee must pay back the CERB. Can the Prime Minister tell us whether employees who decide to return to work have to pay back the full $2,000per month, or only $500for week of the month?
Hon. Diane Lebouthillier : As I mentioned, we believe that Canadians are going through a very difficult time, and we need to support them. We need to help people pay for their groceries and their housing. That's what our government is committed to, and that's what we'll continue to do.
Mr. Alain Rayes : Mr.Chair, the extremely simple question I am asking the Minister comes from companies and workers. None of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters, even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency. So let me repeat my question; I don't think there can be a simpler one. The answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the Canada emergency wage subsidy. If an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the CERB, must he reimburse $500for each week he works during the month, or the entire $2,000?
Hon. Carla Qualtrough (Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion) : Mr. Chair, I can clarify that Service Canada will work closely with anybody who transitions either from the CERB to the wage subsidy or from the CERB back to employment to ensure that there's no overpayment, but of course that there's no undue hardship on the individual.
Mr. Alain Rayes : That announcement was made seven weeks ago. The workers want to know how much they have to reimburse. The companies want to know the situation so that they can make decisions on salary assistance. It seems to me that my question is not complicated: do people have to reimburse $500for each week they work in a month, or the full monthly amount of $2,000?
Hon. Carla Qualtrough : Mr. Chair, that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker. That's why Service Canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them. I can assure the member that nobody will be put in a difficult situation. I recognize that there is some uncertainty, but we're trying to address that. Thank you.
The Chair : Mr.Rayes, you have 35seconds left.
Mr. Alain Rayes : The answers that we are getting today are incredible. This is unacceptable, in my view. If an employer complies with the hygiene conditions, can employees still refuse to return to work, and therefore continue to receive the CERB?
Hon. Carla Qualtrough : Mr. Chair, I can assure all Canadians that at the same time as employees have a right to refuse work and employers have an obligation to ensure healthy and safe workplaces, we want all people to be able to go back to work and fee";no;0;yes;3;yes;1;yes;4;yes;2;no;0;yes;1
"The Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)) : I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 20thmeeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. As a reminder to all members, in order to avoid issues with sound, members participating in person should not be connected to the video conference. I want to remind those who are participating by video conference that, when they talk, they must use the channel that corresponds to the language they are speaking in. As usual, please direct your remarks through the chair. We are moving on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on. We will now move on to document submissions. The honourable minister, Mr. Blair.
Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) : Mr. Chair, today I have the honour to table, in both official languages, the 2019 annual report on the RCMPs use of the law enforcement justification provisions. This report addresses the RCMP's use of specified provisions within the law enforcement justification regime, which is set out in subsections 25 to 25 of the Criminal Code. This report also documents the nature of the investigations in which these provisions were used.
The Chair : On tabling of documents, we have Minister Sajjan.
Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence) : Mr. Chair, pursuant to Standing Order 32, I have the honour to table, in both official languages, the 2018-19 progress report on Canada's national action plan for the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions on women, peace and security.
The Chair : Now we'll go to presenting petitions. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during the meeting of a special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. Members who are participating in the meeting in person are kindly asked to bring the signed certificate to the office once the petition has been presented. Presenting petitions, Ms. May.
Ms. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP) : Mr. Chair, I rise to present two petitions. They both pertain to the protection of our natural world. One is an e-petition, and it relates to the threat to pollinators globally. We know that honey bees and other pollinators are essential to food production. The petitioners note that research from around the world points to a threat to pollinators, particularly from a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids. The European Union has taken action on this. The petitioners call on the Government of Canada to practise a precautionary principle and remove from use neonicotinoids in Canada to protect our pollinators. The second petition relates to the ongoing threat to the southern resident killer whales. These iconic whales are much beloved in SaanichGulf Islands, throughout coastal British Columbia and indeed across Canada. The petitioners are calling for more action to be taken as the population of southern resident killer whales continues to decline, more action for boat-free safety zones, more prohibitions around whale tourism to make sure that the whales are safe from those who are keen to watch them from too close a distance, and more of a credible enforcement regime to support these measures to keep the southern resident killer whale population in our waters and not on the list of species that have become extinct.
The Chair : We'll now go to Mr. Genuis.
Mr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC) : Mr. Chair, for over 10 years, members of Parliament from various parties have been trying to pass legislation to deal with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. Irwin Cotler, Borys Wrzesnewskyj, Senator Salma Ataullahjan and I have all proposed bills on this. The petitioners want the House to support Bill S-204. This is another bill that would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. I'm sure petitioners would want me to add that, given the urgency of this issue, perhaps the government could consider bringing forward a government bill on this issue, which would allow the process to move much faster.
The Chair : We'll now go to Mr. Cannings.
Mr. Richard Cannings (South OkanaganWest Kootenay, NDP) : Mr. Chair, I rise here today to present a petition from Canadian citizens in support of motion M-1, which was placed in this House by my colleague the member for New WestminsterBurnaby on the green new deal. These citizens point out that climate change has escalated into a global climate emergency and that Canada must act with ambition and urgency. They call on the government to support M-1, a made in Canada green new deal, to take bold and rapid action to adopt socially equitable climate action to tackle the climate emergency and address worsening socio-economic and racial inequalities at the same time while ending fossil fuel subsidies, closing offshore tax havens, and supporting workers impacted by the transition by creating well-paying, unionized jobs in the shift to a clean and renewable energy economy.
The Chair : We'll now go to Mr. Johns.
Mr. Gord Johns (CourtenayAlberni, NDP) : Mr. Chair, it's an honour and privilege to table e-petition 2577, which was sponsored by Chris Alemany from Port Alberni and is supported by 5,183 petitioners. They're calling on the Government of Canada to work urgently across party lines and in partnership with provincial and territorial governments to implement a guaranteed, consistent, national and livable universal basic income system for all Canadians. The petition is very timely, coming almost one year to the day since the completion of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which also called on the government to establish a guaranteed annual livable income for all Canadians. Whether it's about providing a safety net to get through a global pandemic, the means to keep your children out of poverty at any time, or simply being able to afford safe housing or transportation, it's time for Canada to have this conversation.
The Chair : We'll now go to Mr. Manly.
Mr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP) : Mr. Chair, it's an honour and a privilege to present a petition on behalf of the constituents of NanaimoLadysmith. People are concerned about gas fracking and the use of methane and the destruction that methane causes to our atmosphere and with climate change. They're calling on the government to commit to upholding the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action by immediately halting all existing and planned construction of the Coastal GasLink project on the Wet'suwet'en territory, and by ordering the RCMP to dismantle their exclusion zone and to stand down. They also call on the government to schedule nation-to-nation talks between the Wet'suwet'en nation and the federal and provincial governmentswhich is something that we're happy to see has been happening and I commend the government for that effortand to prioritize the implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
The Chair : Next is Mr. Lamoureux.
Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Winnipeg North, Lib.) : Mr. Chair, like Canada, Guyana is part of the Commonwealth, and many constituents of Winnipeg North have raised the issue with regard to the presidential election back in March, when it was being called into question. There have been some very positive indications in recent days, but the petitioners are asking the Government of Canada, and in fact all members of Parliament, to be aware of what's taking place in Guyana, and as much as possible, to be advocates for democracy and make sure that we're being diligent in supporting what the people of Guyana want to see.
The Chair : I just want to remind the honourable members, when presenting petitions, to be as concise as possible. I notice they're starting to stretch a bit and it's something we all tend to do. Now we'll go to Statements by Members. The first statement will be from Mr. Lefebvre.
Mr. Paul Lefebvre (Sudbury, Lib.) : Mr. Chair, I just want to say thank you to the industrious people of Sudbury who have risen to the challenge and joined forces in the face of COVID-19. I am proud of all my constituents, and all Canadians, including first responders, volunteers, health care and essential workers, local miners, the farmers and produce growers who are feeding our families, and local businesses who are staying connected with their staff. I also salute all our homegrown innovations such as ProStitch and King Sportswear face masks; Crosscut Distillery hand sanitizer; Nobel Prize winner SNOLAB's work on ventilators, which earned a federal contract; Vale Canada's $1 million in seed capital to small firms developing COVID-19 health solutions; and many more.  We are all in the same boat, but we will get out of it together.
The Chair : We will now go to Mr. Dalton.
Mr. Marc Dalton (Pitt MeadowsMaple Ridge, CPC) : Mr. Chair, Pitt Meadows is one of Canada's most beautiful communities. It's tucked in between the Fraser and Pitt rivers and is in the shadow of Golden Ears mountain. Most of the area consists of farmland, golf courses, parks and conservation areas. It also has Pitt Lake, which is among the largest freshwater tidal lakes in the world. Pitt Meadows' history dates back thousands of years with Katzie First Nation. In the 1900s Dutch immigrants drained and diked the marshes allowing for today's bumper crops of cranberries and blueberries. It's hard to believe that this community is only a short commute to Vancouver and has one of the nation's busiest general aviation airports. Last weekend the community came together to celebrate Pitt Meadows Day a little differently because of COVID. In a great show of community spirit, from their front yards and balconies, thousands of residents came out to cheer for first responders and essential workers as we paraded throughout the city. I am thankful to have raised my family here, taught in the schools and to now be the member of Parliament representing this wonderful community.
The Chair : We will now go to Mr. Kelloway.
Mr. Mike Kelloway (Cape BretonCanso, Lib.) : Mr. Chair, over the last few months I have watched constituents in my riding come together to look out for one another during these challenging times. Regardless of how deep and painful this pandemic has been, it continues to amaze me just how brightly the collective character of Cape BretonCanso shines through. Whether it is someone like Glen Muise, who delivers iPads to seniors' homes so they can connect with loved ones, teachers who deliver meals to students in need, Liam and Lucus Sakalauskas, two young boys who keep youth informed across the east coast, or Rose Fitzgerald, who delivered bouquets made from the remaining flowers from her shop to essential workers across her county, constituents in Cape BretonCanso have stepped up to support their community and to support those in need. Mr. Chair, as you know it is with great pride that I represent my constituents in Cape BretonCanso. The people in Cape Breton and northeastern Nova Scotia care deeply about one another. They know that as a community, we're only as strong as our most vulnerable people, and I cannot help but be filled with joy when I see these gestures happening across my riding. Thanks so much.
The Chair : Ms. Brub, go ahead.
Ms. Sylvie Brub (AbitibiBaie-JamesNunavikEeyou, BQ) : Mr.Chair, unacceptable incidents of police brutality against aboriginals have prompted former member Romeo Saganash, whose commitment I commend, to call for a commission of inquiry similar to the Viens commission in Quebec. The Bloc is open to the idea, but we shouldn't wait for such an inquiry to be recommended to take action. There are already potential solutions for taking action. Commissions have been issuing reports for decades, and Ottawa has been tabling them. Last year alone, the Viens report and the report stemming from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls contained dozens of recommendations. The federal government must work with indigenous peoples, Quebec and the provinces to establish adequate funding for indigenous police forces. Civilian ethics organizations should be created to oversee the RCMP. Police officers and the general population must be better educated on indigenous realities and cultures. Hundreds of pages must be written and actions taken to restore confidence in law enforcement so as to achieve the long-overdue reconciliation. Let's take action.
The Chair : I give the floor to Mr.MacKinnon.
Mr. Steven MacKinnon (Gatineau, Lib.) : Mr.Chair, on behalf of myself and my parliamentary colleagues, I want to congratulate students from our high school class of 2020. We know that, owing to the pandemic, graduation celebrations will be different this year, as students will be deprived of their prom, their graduation ceremony and, in some cases, their goodbyes to friends and teachers. I know how disappointed students from the high schools of duVersant, LeCarrefour, Nicolas-Gatineau, de l'rablire, Collge Saint-Alexandre, Collge Nouvelles Frontires, Collge Saint-Joseph, Philemon-Wright and other regional schools, are not to be able to celebrate their five years of incredible efforts surrounded by their families and friends who were by their side on a daily basis. However, that takes nothing away from their accomplishment. So when they receive their diploma, here is what I will say to them: Surge ahead! The future belongs to you. Be ambitious, follow your dreams and, most importantly, continue to change the Outaouais and the world! The class of 2020 will be remembered for a long time.
The Chair : We will now go to Mr. Morantz.
Mr. Marty Morantz (CharleswoodSt. JamesAssiniboiaHeadingley, CPC) : Mr. Chair, I am delighted to rise to talk about the Bruce Oake Recovery Centre, which is now under construction in my riding in Winnipeg. This state-of-the-art addictions recovery facility was made into a reality by Scott, Anne and Darcy Oake in memory of their son and brother Bruce, who passed away tragically from an accidental overdose in 2011. The Bruce Oake Recovery Centre will provide help to thousands of Manitobans to manage their addiction and reintegrate into the community. I was proud to support this project when I voted for it during my time on Winnipeg City Council. The addictions crisis in Canada needs action. With approximately eight million Canadians suffering from addictions, we need centres like these to help them recover so that no other family will face a heartbreaking loss due to addiction. I want to congratulate the Oakes for their commitment to making recovery for many a reality. Addictions affect us all, and we all have a part to play in contributing to the solution.
The Chair : We will now go to Mr. Jowhari.
Mr. Majid Jowhari (Richmond Hill, Lib.) : Mr. Chair, I would like to recognize the compassion and generosity demonstrated in my riding of Richmond Hill. Week after week residents and organizations have come together to support our most vulnerable during a time of great difficulty. I want to thank the champions of the community who were generous enough to donate masks and other supplies as well as services. I would also like to recognize the charities and care centres which, upon receiving these donations, redoubled their efforts to serve their communities. Special thanks go to the Mon Sheong Foundation Long-Term Care Centre, Divine Favour Senior Homecare, the Community & Home Assistance to Seniors, the True Compassion Home Health centre, Blue Door, the Mosaic Interfaith Out of the Cold program, Yellow Brick House, Hill House Hospice, Community Living York South, and Parya Trillium Foundation for continuing to support the residents in my riding of Richmond Hill. The compassionate generosity demonstrated by these donors and organizations makes me proud to represent my community in Parliament.
The Chair : We'll now go to Madam Lalonde.
Mrs. Marie-France Lalonde (Orlans, Lib.) : Thank you, Mr.Chair. Usually, at this time of the year, I have the pleasure of being invited to the graduation ceremony of the grade12 students in Orlans. However, we will all have to adapt to a new reality this year. I cannot express enough how, in these exceptional times, I have witnessed the strength, resilience and community spirit of our graduates. I also know that a number of high schools have made significant efforts to celebrate the success of their graduating class. Young graduate Maryanne Collard was amazed to see that people from her school, the cole secondaire catholique Batrice-Desloges, had installed a sign in her garden to congratulate her on her academic success.  As we move forward we must not forget that youth in this country are our future. We have a responsibility to be there for them and to believe in them. We will not fail.  I thank the teachers, the support staff and school management who are continuing to do their work. Congratulations to all graduates of 2020.
The Chair : We'll now go to Mr. Vis.
Mr. Brad Vis (MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, CPC) : Mr. Chair, COVID-19 has changed and challenged how we go about our daily lives. For many this includes a shift to working from home or attending school remotely. The sad reality is that even before the crisis hit, most rural Canadians simply did not have access to a strong and stable Internet connection, even though Internet is an essential service. Those in underserved areas, including many parts of MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, cannot work from home and their children cannot keep up with their classmates. For many of my indigenous constituents, Internet services are stuck in the 1990s because telecom companies don't want to serve them. I, along with my colleagues, launched community consultations to address this critical issue and provide solutions. We call on the government to outline and implement a concrete action plan to address Internet connectivity deficits between rural and urban Canada. This is an issue I will continue to press on until results are achieved.
The Chair : We'll now go to Mr. McLeod.
Mr. Michael McLeod (Northwest Territories, Lib.) : Mr. Chair, Canada has been awarded its first-ever Equator Prize from the United Nations Development Programme. Congratulations go to Lutsl K' Dene First Nation and the Northwest Territory Mtis Nation, with support from Deninu K'ue First Nation and the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, for the establishment of the Thaidene Nn territorial protected area. It's 14,000 square kilometres of the most beautiful land and waters you'll find anywhere on earth. I would also like to thank the previous minister of the environment for securing Canada's $7.9-million commitment, along with our visit to celebrate the new park last year. The award is given to groups that have exemplified actions to protect critical ecosystems and biodiversity for generations to come and to show how indigenous peoples and local communities have confronted legacies of disadvantage and discrimination in support of their communities and the world at large. Congratulations to Lutsl K'.
The Chair : We'll now go to Ms. Falk.
Mrs. Rosemarie Falk (BattlefordsLloydminster, CPC) : Mr. Chair, the Liberal government has tabled $87 billion in spending and allocated just four hours for Parliament to study, debate and pass it. The allocated time is wholly inadequate. Canadians deserve to know how that money is being spent. They deserve to know that this government spending was scrutinized and passed through the rigours of Parliament. It is Canadian taxpayers of today and tomorrow who will have the responsibility to pay for this government's spending. It is Canadian workers and businesses who will have to do the hard work of rebuilding our economy. It is real Canadians who fall through the cracks when this Liberal government's programs fail to meet their intended goals. A rubber stamp under the guise of health and safety is not democracy. Canadians are owed better. Just as we gather four days a week for a hybrid committee meeting, parliamentarians can gather to do the full scope of the work that Canadians elected us to do.
The Chair : We now go to Mr. Godin.
Mr. Jol Godin (PortneufJacques-Cartier, CPC) : Thank you, Mr.Chair. Our planet is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our daily lives have been turned upside down. I am thinking of you, our seniors, valuable individuals who built our country. You have gone through a very restrictive confinement. You have had to sacrifice time spent with your families. Our students also had to adapt. Their school year was turned on its head. Our graduating class, especially, saw their dream of a proper graduation vanish. The future belongs to them. They must follow their dreams. I want to say to all the essential staff and the many support organizations that they are really changing things. We have all taken on our important responsibility, that of following the guidelines. The results have been most compelling in my riding. I want to say how proud I am to represent you here, in the Canadian Parliament. I thank each and everyone of you. You are helping PortneufJacques-Cartier flourish. You have shown resilience, creativity, innovation and solidarity. That is commendable. Together, we will get through this ordeal and come out stronger.
The Chair : We'll now go to Ms. Gazan.
Ms. Leah Gazan (Winnipeg Centre, NDP) : Mr. Chair, today I rise to honour Justice 4 Black Lives Winnipeg, led by women and non-binary individuals, who stood together and mobilized our city to state clearly that we will not stand by and stay silent in the face of police brutality. We will not stand by in the face of systemic racism. We will not stand by while we witness our bodies being abused by centuries of racism supported through legislation that has left us vulnerable at the hands of those who abuse their power. We will speak out against police violence. We will speak out against systemic racism. We will join together to ensure that laws are instituted that are designed to protect us, not abuse us. We will call out those who abuse their power. We will rise. We will rise. We will rise. To all the women and non-binary folks who are standing, I say, let's continue to sound our voices in solidarity and support of one another until indigenous and black lives are honoured and respected. Our liberation is intertwined. Solidarity.
The Chair : Mrs.DeBellefeuille, go ahead.
Mrs. Claude DeBellefeuille (SalaberrySurot, BQ) : Mr.Chair, this is not the time for governments to get complacent about COVID-19. However, the last few days have shown that we are once again dealing with a reckless Prime Minister. First, he locked down Parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition, while the economic recovery must be prepared. He is refusing to provide an economic update, even though the Parliamentary Budget Officer is calling for it. We need to know how much flexibility we have in case of a second wave of the pandemic. He is refusing to hold a first ministers meeting on unconditional health transfers. The increase Quebec needs is for hiring health care staff before a second wave, and not after it. Finally, today, he is refusing to negotiate with any party to get his bill passed. He is behaving as if he had a majority government. This is not a time for recklessness. Governing means anticipating. I am asking the Prime Minister to pull himself together.
The Chair : We will now go to Mr. Uppal.
Hon. Tim Uppal (Edmonton Mill Woods, CPC) : Mr. Chair, I rise to give thanks and recognition to the contributions of many businesses and organizations across my riding of Edmonton Mill Woods that have stepped up in a major way during this pandemic. I joined my friends in the Filipino community who partnered with Mill Woods' Calvary Community Church to deliver care packages to seniors. Varinder Bhullar and his Green Scholars of Alberta team and Dil-E-Punjab restaurant provided thousands of free meals. Sikh Youth Edmonton delivered free groceries to families, seniors and students. Edmonton Towing and its full team with Dukh Nivaran Gudwara prepared food packages for any truckers who were coming through Edmonton. The Bhartiya Cultural Society Hindu temple provided free meals to anyone who needed them. Punjab Insurance and The Punjab chain of restaurants provided free meals in downtown Edmonton. The staff, nurses and doctors of Grey Nuns Community Hospital in the heart of Mill Woods have been keeping people safe and healthy. I want to thank our Mill Woods community as a whole for its continued strength, resilience and compassion as we move forward together.
The Chair : We'll now proceed to Mr. Fonseca.
Mr. Peter Fonseca (Mississauga EastCooksville, Lib.) : Mr. Chair, today is Portugal Day, celebrated both in Portugal and around the world by Portuguese. In Canada, June has been recognized as Portuguese Heritage Month. We're truly happy to recognize the great contributions made by Canadians of Portuguese descent. This year is a difficult one, though, for all of us, including our Portuguese diaspora community across the globe that is deeply affected by the COVID situation. Our prayers and well wishes are with everyone. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our luso community of over half a million members in Canada from coast to coast for staying strong during these difficult times. Your warmth, hard work and team spirit resonate well across my riding of Mississauga EastCooksville and globally. As a Portuguese immigrant who came to Canada at the age of two with my family, I know this year will be a lot different from previous years. I encourage all of you to stay safe and enjoy a Portuguese meal, and please continue to support our local businesses. 
The Chair : We now begin the period of questions for ministers. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings twice in order to allow employees who provide support for sitting to substitute each other very safely. The first question goes to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Scheer.
Hon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition) : Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister is doing everything to avoid being accountable to Canadians. He is refusing to table a budget, refusing to provide an economic update and refusing to let the House of Commons do its work. Will he at least provide the Auditor General with the additional funding she needs to look into government expenditures?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister) : Mr.Chair, not only are we introducing a bill this afternoon to help Canadians with the Canada emergency response benefit and those living with disabilities, but we are also proposing to the opposition parties that we hold a debate and a vote on that. I hope the opposition parties will allow a vote and a debate in the House on this important bill.
Hon. Andrew Scheer : Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister wants parliamentarians to vote on aspects of the government's spending. We want the Auditor General to be able to examine that government spending. Under the government, the Auditor General has had to do more with less, and her ability to conduct audits is being affected. The Auditor General has indicated that she will be able to do half as many audits, despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending. I have a simple question. Will the Prime Minister give the Auditor General the money she needs to do her job, yes or no?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, we worked with the Auditor General to increase the funding of the Auditor General's office in 2018-19, and the equivalent of 38 full-time staff were added. We support the Auditor General, unlike the Conservative government, which fired 60 people from the Auditor General's office. We are now proposing that we sit down to debate legislation this afternoon, and I certainly hope that members opposite will vote for debate.
Hon. Andrew Scheer : The Prime Minister is again engaged in revisionist history. He well knows that it was the Auditor General's office that volunteered to make administrative efficiencies, which did not affect its ability to do the job. In fact, as the interim auditor general, John Wiersema, said, We would not have proposed if we didnt think it was the right thing to do and that wed be able to carry out our role for Parliament. Only the government's refusal to grant that extra funding is hampering the Auditor General's ability to give Canadians the answers they deserve, and we wonder why. This is the government that cannot explain where 20,000 infrastructure projects went and where five billion dollars' worth of supposed infrastructure investments have gone. They can't identify that. Then there is, of course, the $35-billion Infrastructure Bank, which has completed precisely zero projects. Are these the reasons the Prime Minister is so intent on withholding funds from the Auditor General?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, talking of revisionist history, Stephen Harper's Conservatives cut $6.5 million from the Auditor General's budget and fired 60 staff. On the contrary, we worked with the Auditor General's office and increased its funding and added the equivalent of 38 new full-time staff. We will continue to demonstrate openness and transparency. We will continue to respect the officers of Parliament, whom the Conservatives, in their time in office, showed no respect for. We will continue to move forward in a way that has led, for example, to proposing debate and voting on important legislation this afternoon to help Canadians. The Conservatives don't seem to want that debate or vote.
Hon. Andrew Scheer : Mr. Chair, it's no surprise that the Prime Minister likes to reach back into history from before the 2015 election to justify his position. The 2015 election was the only time he got more votes than the Conservative Party did, so I understand why he likes to live in the past. In May, the interim auditor general said, Ten years ago, we were completing about 27 performance audits every year. With our current resources, we expect to be able to deliver 14 performance audits each year. That's half the number of audits, despite a massive explosion in government spending. The Auditor General's office has requested more funds to be able to do the job that Canadians expect to be done. Will the Prime Minister give those additional funds to the Auditor General's office, yes or no?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, we very much look forward to working with the new Auditor General to ensure that her office has the ability to continue the important audits and transparency measures that are foundational to our institutions. Speaking of what is foundational to our institutions, this afternoon we're putting forward a bill that would help Canadians across the country, and we've proposed to debate and vote on that bill. It actually looks like the Conservatives and other opposition parties might not want this. They have been complaining about not having debates and votes in Parliament, and now they're proposing not to have them. That's a little head-scratching. We hope they're going to help Canadians.
The Chair : We will continue with Mr.Blanchet.
Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet (BeloeilChambly, BQ) : Thank you, Mr.Chair. We may have a chance here to replace a problem with a good opportunity. This morning, we heard many groups and organizations that represent people with a disability express their concerns over the bill introduced by the government, which I feel is chocolate pudding containing cod liver oil. We agree with the chocolate pudding. We are favourable to helping people with a disability. People don't know the rules. They don't knowI am telling them nowthat a bill can be divided. It can be cut into parts and voted on in parts. The rest of the bill can be enhanced. I am saying to the Prime Minister that, if he presents the part on disabled individuals, it will be passed at the speed of light. He won't even see it happen. Is he prepared to divide the bill, so that we can work together to help people with a disability?
Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : The bill that we are proposing this afternoon will certainly help people living with disabilities. We can always recognize that this is important, and every party should be open to it. We will also increase the flexibility of the Canada emergency response benefit from four-week intervals to two weeks. We will also expand the scope of the wage subsidy so that more businesses will have access to it. I am always willing to work with members of the opposition to ";no;0;yes;2;yes;1;yes;5;no;0;no;0;yes;1

Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Okay . That was fun , right . Um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . Any ideas ?
Industrial Designer : It's about {disfmarker}
User Interface : One point four or something like that .
Industrial Designer : mm , mm yeah .
Marketing : Seventeen .
User Interface : One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , something like that ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : so that {disfmarker}
Project Manager : D fifteen ?
Industrial Designer : yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that .
Project Manager : Seventeen .
Marketing : Seventeen Pounds .
Project Manager : Okay , that's expensive .
Marketing : Should we be making notes of this ? We can just refer to this later can't we ?
Project Manager : I think so , I think so ,
Industrial Designer : But {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I'll be able to um pull it up ,
Marketing : Yeah , okay .
Project Manager : or I could put it in the shared folder or something .
Industrial Designer : Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those {disfmarker} the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway .
Marketing : Okay .
Industrial Designer : So , it'd still be {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Really ?
Marketing : Right .
Industrial Designer : yeah , we had to buy one {vocalsound} .
Marketing : So
Project Manager : Mm . I think {disfmarker}
Marketing : so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ?
Project Manager : Yeah , um production cost's at twelve fifty , so
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
User Interface : Okay , pretty huge margin .
Project Manager : half of the selling price is taken up by building it .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros ,
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : which is uh {disfmarker}
Marketing : In our first year ?
Project Manager : Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : So then {disfmarker}
Marketing : You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a {disfmarker} um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone
Project Manager : No , yeah .
Marketing : {disfmarker} user-friendly to everyone . Okay .
Project Manager : So {disfmarker}
Marketing : Big target group {vocalsound} .
Project Manager : yes , yes , I don't think we have to {disfmarker} I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point ,
Marketing : No .
Project Manager : just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that .
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : Okay . What are your experiences with remote controls ? I mean I've got {disfmarker} we got um {disfmarker} we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Alright .
User Interface : that c
Project Manager : but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah uh .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : but that was quite good , the fact that you could {disfmarker} You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you .
Industrial Designer : Use all the ones at the same time .
Marketing : Right .
User Interface : Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah ,
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : 'cause you {disfmarker}
Marketing : My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions ,
Project Manager : Mm .
Marketing : I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well .
Project Manager : Yeah , the main {disfmarker} that's the main stuff anyway , I mean
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : {disfmarker} and you don't want to {disfmarker} I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Mm . And symbols that you don't necessarily understand ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : symbols you're meant to understand that you don't .
User Interface : So simplification of symbols you could think of .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Um . When they're {disfmarker} when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it .
Marketing : Oh yeah . Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : 'Cause it doesn't make {disfmarker} when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at ,
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : it's obvious what you're doing , um .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Mm .
Marketing : Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display ,
User Interface : Mm-hmm . Menu , alright .
Marketing : I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : Uh uh {disfmarker}
Marketing : so you've got a little L_C_D_ display .
User Interface : Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .
Marketing : With menus , yeah , yeah .
User Interface : And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ?
User Interface : {vocalsound} You mean to save it lesser number .
Project Manager : Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?
User Interface : Right .
Project Manager : I don't think they tape things ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so {vocalsound}
Project Manager : I don't think they use {disfmarker}
Marketing : Right . Right . So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps ,
Project Manager : Mm , yeah , the age gap .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , what it just needs to be {disfmarker} as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .
Project Manager : Mm .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : I don't know , I d
Industrial Designer : But I don't know how {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system .
Industrial Designer : Oh yeah .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost {vocalsound} in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one
Marketing : Right .
Project Manager : and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get ,
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume .
Marketing : Mm-hmm . Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : Teletext has got that option as well .
Marketing : Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .
Project Manager : Yeah . Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : and also {disfmarker} and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is {disfmarker} you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : Mm , okay . S
Project Manager : I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Y
User Interface : It might
Marketing : Yeah ?
User Interface : it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Yes , no that's important .
User Interface : But it might have its cost implications .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah , like smaller .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?
Project Manager : Mm .
User Interface : Right .
Marketing : Something that's easily moulded and produced .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Um , right , okay
Industrial Designer : No uh uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Just just a quick thing about the um {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Sure .
Industrial Designer : about what you're saying about the uh {disfmarker} does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of {disfmarker} I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh {disfmarker} we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui
Marketing : Ah right .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : Okay .
Industrial Designer : I mean you don't {disfmarker} you you can still have plastic
Marketing : Sure b y yeah .
Industrial Designer : and it'd look quite good but {disfmarker}
Marketing : But {disfmarker} yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know {vocalsound} th that was my main point ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper ,
Project Manager : Mm .
Marketing : I presume it would .
Project Manager : I would {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Project Manager : it would probably . I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter ,
Marketing : Right .
Project Manager : so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : Okay , so let's break it up there . Okay ?
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Marketing : 'Kay .
Project Manager : So , see you in half an hour .
Marketing : Do we go back to our room ? Yep ?
User Interface : Mm , yeah .
Project Manager : I think so , yeah .";yes;4;yes;3;yes;2;yes;3;yes;4;no;0;yes;4
"Project Manager : Help . {gap} It's up there ? That screen's black .
Marketing : {gap}
Industrial Designer : {gap}
Project Manager : Alright , okay . Okay , that's fine .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh God .
Project Manager : Are we done ? Right , okay um , this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?
Marketing : Uh , no that's okay ,
Project Manager : Okay , um {vocalsound}
Marketing : sorry .
Project Manager : I'll go over what we decided last meeting ,
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : um , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video equipment .
User Interface : Sorry .
Project Manager : Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing . Um , our budget would have to affect um {disfmarker} try not to reflect our budget , um that we might have a bit of {disfmarker} oh oh you can see it , okay {vocalsound} . Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . We discussed a flip-open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that . Okay . Um , three presentations , I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first ?
Marketing : Um is it okay if I postpone that til later , I just want to get access to a little bit more information ,
Project Manager : No that's fine , that's fine . {gap}
Marketing : is that okay ?
Industrial Designer : Okay , yeah I'll go first . Can I grab the {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Unplug me .
Industrial Designer : Thanks . What do I have to press ? Oh , F_ eight ?
Project Manager : Um , F_N_ function F_ eight .
Industrial Designer : Oh right , yeah . Okay . Maybe {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yep .
Industrial Designer : Yep there we go . Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : 'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What {disfmarker} the first thing {disfmarker} question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that {disfmarker} well it wasn't really my area because {vocalsound} I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one {vocalsound} .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Um and uh {vocalsound} I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .
Marketing : Mm-hmm . Could I {disfmarker} can I interject to ask a question there ,
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Yeah sure .
Marketing : is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the {gap} surrounding it ?
Industrial Designer : Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries ,
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in .
Marketing : Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah the the {disfmarker}
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : They are .
Industrial Designer : well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption
Marketing : Oh I see .
Industrial Designer : and how much you need to send the data across .
Marketing : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . {vocalsound} Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the {disfmarker} w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh {disfmarker} just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do .
User Interface : {gap}
Industrial Designer : It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the {vocalsound} uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would {disfmarker} the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to {vocalsound} whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and {disfmarker} reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . And then finally , um we want uh the {disfmarker} it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of {disfmarker} d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa {vocalsound} thing that you could have ,
Marketing : Mm . Mm .
Industrial Designer : I {disfmarker} th that was just sort of a general point there .
Marketing : Mm .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} And that's uh {disfmarker} yeah .
Marketing : That's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present .
Industrial Designer : Alright okay , and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there ,
Project Manager : Okay , thank you very much .
Industrial Designer : so if you wanna {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Um , would you like to continue on from that ?
User Interface : Yep .
Industrial Designer : Ooh .
User Interface : 'Kay . It can be {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Or , maybe move the laptop over .
User Interface : okay , that's okay with me . {gap} further . {gap}
Project Manager : {gap}
User Interface : Oops . Why's it not working ? F_ eight , right ?
Project Manager : F_ function .
Industrial Designer : Function F_ eight yeah .
User Interface : Okay . Mm why's it in the right ?
Marketing : No . The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? No .
User Interface : Yeah , it's connecting {gap} .
Industrial Designer : No , no yeah it's just {gap} .
Marketing : Meter adjusting .
User Interface : {gap} okay .
Project Manager : Oh , there {gap} .
User Interface : Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's {disfmarker} it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering {gap} maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will {gap} this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you {disfmarker} you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like {disfmarker} it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh {disfmarker} added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not {disfmarker} of no use of punching in the uh {disfmarker} trying to put in those things in {disfmarker} on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in {disfmarker} add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's {disfmarker} so this is {disfmarker} if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use {disfmarker} usage and all that .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : Uh any comments like , if you want ?
Project Manager : 'Kay . Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end ,
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah sure .
Marketing : 'Kay .
Project Manager : Ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange . Oh , God . Right , okay .
User Interface : I think you'll have to {disfmarker}
Marketing : Have I got to keep this here ?
User Interface : You can't {disfmarker}
Marketing : Does it matter ?
User Interface : It'll have to {disfmarker} this can't be pulled .
Marketing : I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ?
Project Manager : We just do the best we can .
Marketing : Uh , whoops .
User Interface : You'll have to push it a bit more .
Marketing : Will it manage ? Bit more ,
User Interface : Yep .
Marketing : oh dear . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah this is more than enough . Okay .
Industrial Designer : There we go , I've got a bit more of the cable {vocalsound} .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Oh . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : There we go .
Marketing : Is that okay ?
User Interface : Yeah I think you can pull it out now .
Marketing : Thank you ,
User Interface : {gap}
Marketing : just pull it closer a little bit .
Industrial Designer : Uh you should be able to {gap} and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , you might .
Industrial Designer : yeah , there you go .
Marketing : Get it right over , okay , thank you .
Project Manager : Ah . Look at that .
Marketing : Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . {vocalsound} Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . {vocalsound} Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there . {vocalsound} Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take {disfmarker} said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh {disfmarker} when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this . {vocalsound} I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you ,
User Interface : 'Kay .
Marketing : but I think I'll just keep it simple ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : if there's any more information I can email you extra details ,
User Interface : {gap} That's fine .
Project Manager : Okay . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Marketing : is that okay ?
Project Manager : Right , um
Industrial Designer : Huh .
Project Manager : we have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext ,
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um {vocalsound} our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it limits the cost for us ,
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .
Marketing : Mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?
Project Manager : It says for T_V_ only , so {vocalsound} looks like it's just {disfmarker}
Marketing : Just channel-hopping .
Project Manager : yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but {vocalsound} I don't know , what do you think ? It just said , for T_V_ only . But I mean , general T_V_ controls do do video as well .
Marketing : Would that imply video use ?
Industrial Designer : T yeah yeah . I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g
Project Manager : I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah . If yeah {disfmarker}
Marketing : Mm-hmm , yes .
Industrial Designer : and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so .
Project Manager : Mm . I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and {vocalsound} programming .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?
Marketing : Yes .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons ,
User Interface : Ten perc
Project Manager : Mm .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare {vocalsound}
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : Hmm .
Industrial Designer : Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : Pens
Industrial Designer : and they're not that great anyway .
Marketing : In fact I've just called up that table there ,
Industrial Designer : Alright , okay .
Marketing : we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ?
Industrial Designer : Alright , okay .
Marketing : So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there ,
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology .
Project Manager : Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah but um on on that again I just thought {disfmarker} 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : bu
Marketing : Oh yeah .
Industrial Designer : so I thought that could be quite a {disfmarker}
Marketing : Right .
Project Manager : We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : um because it is something I {disfmarker} it needs to be {disfmarker} the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager : maybe {vocalsound} on the T_V_ {disfmarker} you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Yes . That's a super idea .
Project Manager : but that's {disfmarker} that sounds a lot cheaper to me .
Industrial Designer : Hmm . Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Um {vocalsound} the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um , people paying more for it to look good . Um , we need to focus on that as well .
Marketing : Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno ,
Project Manager : Mm .
Marketing : you get the idea . It's it's gonna vary around the world . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may {disfmarker} and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs {gap} ?
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Sure .
Industrial Designer : Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs
User Interface : Alright .
Industrial Designer : I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same .
User Interface : Right .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : The features could be same and the body could look slightly different .
Industrial Designer : Just {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : yeah , yeah .
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : What about {disfmarker} you were talking about the buttons ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers
Industrial Designer : 'Kay . Yeah , yeah that's what I was just {disfmarker} yeah .
Project Manager : yeah ? Um so you {disfmarker} it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the {disfmarker}
User Interface : {gap}
Industrial Designer : No , well no 'cause you wouldn't have to {disfmarker} you don't actually have to press them you just {disfmarker}
Project Manager : You don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it .
User Interface : {gap}
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : Um , think that might appeal {disfmarker} I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people ,
Marketing : Mm . Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : trendy kind of a thing .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def
Project Manager : Um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can {gap} oh yeah that's obvious what that's for
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um {disfmarker}
Marketing : Mm-hmm , mm .
Industrial Designer : Mm . But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um {vocalsound} if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big
Project Manager : Were too big .
Industrial Designer : because um {vocalsound} they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands
Project Manager : Mm .
Industrial Designer : so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh {disfmarker} so if you {disfmarker} I don't know what {disfmarker} 'cause you {disfmarker} obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others .
User Interface : Yeah , uh maybe to {disfmarker} as uh {disfmarker} it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface : So , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah .
Project Manager : I think we have to design one product
Industrial Designer : Hmm . Huh .
Project Manager : and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely .
Project Manager : It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . Um , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : I'm j I really can't get my head round this one ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about .
Industrial Designer : I {disfmarker} yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause {disfmarker} without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel
Marketing : Mm . I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know .
Industrial Designer : and it becomes {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Or a speech recognition ,
Industrial Designer : yeah . Yeah , speech recognition ,
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : which is extremely expensive ,
Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue .
Industrial Designer : yeah .
Marketing : Yes . Mm-hmm . Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? Um .
User Interface : We could focus on the biggest market .
Industrial Designer : Mm .
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?
Industrial Designer : Ge uh {disfmarker}
Marketing : And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .
Project Manager : We are {disfmarker} we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well . That they want um it to be fashionable ,
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume {disfmarker} associate that with the older generations .
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Mm-hmm {vocalsound} .
Project Manager : but I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um , business kind of class type people .
Marketing : Mm . Mm . I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first {disfmarker} it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .
Project Manager : Okay , so the remote control functions . Um we've got the T_V_ ,
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : we've got the video , now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details ,
Industrial Designer : Video plus .
Project Manager : yes . We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah .
Project Manager : I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : because you've got your general record anyway so if you {disfmarker} there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in
Industrial Designer : Just whack in the number .
Project Manager : and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that ,
Industrial Designer : And you w {vocalsound}
Project Manager : it's just a number .
Industrial Designer : yeah . And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that ,
Project Manager : No .
Industrial Designer : you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway ,
Project Manager : You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway .
Industrial Designer : yeah .
Marketing : Right , I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful {vocalsound} .
Project Manager : It is
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : after um {disfmarker} if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards
Industrial Designer : It's not {disfmarker} Yeah .
Project Manager : and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth
Marketing : Ah , hmm .
Project Manager : so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times ,
Marketing : Right .
Project Manager : um and it has been around for quite a long time .
Industrial Designer : It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things .
Project Manager : No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that {disfmarker}
Marketing : Superb . Mm .
Industrial Designer : Mm .
Marketing : Yes .
Industrial Designer : Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it {disfmarker} you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on
Project Manager : Mm .
Marketing : Right .
Industrial Designer : and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series .
Marketing : Excellent , mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : So that {disfmarker} yeah .
Marketing : Mm .
Industrial Designer : But just to have that function would be would be really good .
Marketing : Right .
Project Manager : Okay so {disfmarker}
Marketing : Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age grou";yes;4;yes;4;yes;3;yes;3;yes;3;no;0;yes;3
"Project Manager : I'll wait until you're all um hooked up .
Marketing : Oh good grief .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : 'Kay .
Project Manager : Okay . {gap}
Marketing : Oh .
Project Manager : Put it on in that way .
User Interface : Oops .
Project Manager : Thanks . Okay .
User Interface : Mm .
Project Manager : Welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : After lunch . Yeah .
Project Manager : Right um this is our conceptual design meeting ,
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : um {vocalsound} I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting ,
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah I was getting that impression as well .
Project Manager : I th I I think {disfmarker} yeah um .
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : This is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching .
Industrial Designer : Etcetera .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . Um the minutes from the last time . Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . Um we have decided on a {disfmarker} leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal . We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , um . You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost ,
User Interface : {gap}
Project Manager : things like that ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : um and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range .
User Interface : 'Kay .
Project Manager : Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ?
Marketing : Shall I ?
User Interface : Yep .
Project Manager : Yes if you feel {disfmarker}
Marketing : Okay . We just connect up .
Project Manager : {gap}
Marketing : Thank you . There we go . Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um {vocalsound} the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional {disfmarker} uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch ,
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : It's okay {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : sorry Project Manager {vocalsound} . Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . {vocalsound} Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . Be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
User Interface : 'Kay .
Project Manager : Okay thank you very much . Um
User Interface : Yep .
Project Manager : let's start from the inside and work our way out .
User Interface : Fine . It's okay with me .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay . {gap}
Marketing : Unless anyone has any questions about that ?
Project Manager : I don't think so , not yet .
Marketing : Not yet ? 'Kay .
Project Manager : Um , yes , thank you .
Industrial Designer : That screwed in ? {gap}
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : I hate those little things
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .
Marketing : {vocalsound} I know .
Industrial Designer : 'Kay , {gap} {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Okay . Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the {disfmarker} Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't {disfmarker} un unfortunately aren't available .
Project Manager : 'Kay . {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer : Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment .
Project Manager : 'Kay .
Industrial Designer : Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we {disfmarker} I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest ,
Project Manager : Wa {vocalsound} can you explain that ?
Industrial Designer : people won't {disfmarker} it's it's basically like wind-up radio .
Project Manager : Like a {disfmarker} right , okay .
Industrial Designer : So you wind up your remote control before you use it .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : How {vocalsound} {disfmarker} what kind of {disfmarker} how l long can you get out of that ,
Industrial Designer : It might {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : You {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get {disfmarker} when when you got T_V_ .
Project Manager : That doesn't count though does it ?
Marketing : Does does light charge as as sunlight does ?
Project Manager : I thought it was U_V_ like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : No .
Marketing : Artificial light ?
Industrial Designer : Is it ? Alright i
Project Manager : Any , any {disfmarker}
Marketing : Has to be solar .
User Interface : Yep . Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or {disfmarker} and dynamo might take more space .
Industrial Designer : Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up .
Project Manager : I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay .
Project Manager : Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights
Marketing : Mm . Artificial light , no .
Project Manager : no , but I mean not many {disfmarker} you don't want to limit your market .
Marketing : That's going to {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people .
User Interface : Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing : I know ,
Industrial Designer : But {disfmarker}
Marketing : different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally .
Industrial Designer : Yeah
User Interface : Right .
Industrial Designer : and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway .
User Interface : Night .
Project Manager : Mm , but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening .
Industrial Designer : But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches
Project Manager : Yeah I've seen {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : and you d you don't even notice it . I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .
User Interface : And are these like uh {disfmarker} what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?
Industrial Designer : Um yeah it's {disfmarker} it charges into um some form of {disfmarker} it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery ,
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches .
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out {gap} .
User Interface : We c
Project Manager : But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . If you'd {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I mean you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Yeah but then again
Project Manager : Is it really gonna be enough ?
Industrial Designer : I I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um {vocalsound} it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : And th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it
Project Manager : So it's not {disfmarker} the draw on it isn't {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : and you put it {disfmarker}
Marketing : Hmm .
Industrial Designer : no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be {disfmarker}
Marketing : Mm-hmm . Mm .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : Could I just ask {disfmarker} referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ?
Industrial Designer : Mm .
Marketing : I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging
Industrial Designer : Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing
Marketing : or the two things not compatible ?
Project Manager : Like a dual kind of .
Industrial Designer : but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they {disfmarker} because , if you lie {gap} {disfmarker} on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .
Marketing : Mm . So that affects the exterior design .
User Interface : Solar would be slightly {gap} expensives .
Project Manager : Expensive as well . What kind of price are we looking at for {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : They're they're expensive , they don't {disfmarker}
User Interface : It's twelve point f
Project Manager : I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the {disfmarker} It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping ,
Project Manager : Solar .
Industrial Designer : 'cause if you drop stuff {disfmarker} yeah if you if you have y
Project Manager : Well they're not designed {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if {disfmarker} remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .
Project Manager : Practical-wise okay .
Industrial Designer : Y I think {disfmarker} yeah , practically . I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot {vocalsound} whereas remotes you do ,
Project Manager : You do get a bit of wear
Industrial Designer : they can t
Project Manager : but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah they do , they {disfmarker} yeah they've got dual things , but they're {disfmarker} the batteries are smaller I think .
Project Manager : Mm .
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : Another question is like {disfmarker}
Marketing : Again it de
User Interface : sorry . W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day .
Industrial Designer : Mm .
User Interface : A remote control , like ,
Industrial Designer : W m yeah
User Interface : so we have to s look at the life also .
Marketing : Mm .
Industrial Designer : so the {disfmarker} Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , I don't think you'd {disfmarker} I think the {disfmarker} it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in {disfmarker} or triple A_s would last .
Marketing : It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah I think i I think it would , yeah .
Marketing : i {vocalsound} it's not gonna add anything , okay .
Project Manager : Okay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ?
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : Can we think about that ? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Well add it in to think about um
Marketing : right , okay .
Project Manager : because , where am I ? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : the eternal battle for control of the controls .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research ,
Project Manager : No .
Marketing : it's not a thing that people are looking for
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : So {disfmarker}
Marketing : when we threw it open to the field yeah .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Marketing : But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe .
Project Manager : Okay , right .
Industrial Designer : Okay , well I'll move on .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which {disfmarker} pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .
Project Manager : What kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we {disfmarker} what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Well well this {disfmarker} the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have {disfmarker} fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one ,
Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Okay .
Industrial Designer : if you if you wanted to but um the {disfmarker} there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : so that {disfmarker} And then to {disfmarker} uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was {disfmarker} 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote ,
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up .
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the {disfmarker} there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case {disfmarker} case housing
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : and the the main problems with the {disfmarker} well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium um very expensive just to process ,
Project Manager : Mm .
Industrial Designer : which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber ,
Marketing : Mm .
Industrial Designer : but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite {vocalsound} um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more {disfmarker} they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not {disfmarker} because we'd have it in two separate units
User Interface : Second thing is {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Hinged , yeah .
Industrial Designer : for the flip phone .
User Interface : yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that .
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : So is that feature available in like uh titanium ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah I th
User Interface : or it's like only specific to plastic or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Uh . Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just {disfmarker}
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is {disfmarker}
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote .
Marketing : It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah .
Marketing : I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,
Industrial Designer : Rubber , yeah .
Marketing : that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone .
Industrial Designer : And you can peel them off yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,
Marketing : Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah .
User Interface : Something like {disfmarker}
Project Manager : like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : Alright .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : That could be a good idea .
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : It could {disfmarker} it would be comfortable to hold on also .
Project Manager : Okay . Mm .
Industrial Designer : T
Marketing : Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not .
Marketing : Mm . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Also the {disfmarker}
Project Manager : 'Kay .
Industrial Designer : just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the {disfmarker} I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Now what I was saying before about instead of having {disfmarker} you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over {disfmarker} if you had them close enough , that would be one option . Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen {disfmarker} 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , two they {disfmarker} you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch
User Interface : Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : display . Uh what what {disfmarker}
User Interface : Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely , you're saying like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could {disfmarker} becau you could fit it {disfmarker}
User Interface : Uh-huh .
Industrial Designer : the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve {disfmarker} curved things with it ,
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : but um you can {disfmarker} you wouldn't have {disfmarker} with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board .
Marketing : Mm .
Industrial Designer : With {disfmarker} W also with the {disfmarker}
Marketing : I don't {disfmarker} s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : Oh it would be flat inside .
Industrial Designer : You could have a flat screen inside , yeah ,
Marketing : yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah .
Project Manager : Mm .
Industrial Designer : but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside .
Marketing : Have I misunderstood you ?
Industrial Designer : It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white ,
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : but there'd be touch touch buttons ,
User Interface : 'Kay .
Industrial Designer : so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ .
Project Manager : I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Is rubber . Mm .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest .
Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing : I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ . {vocalsound} Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer : Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out
Project Manager : Like one of the palm pop thing .
Industrial Designer : but I I think they could get a bit easily lost ,
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : Absolutely , f for somebody who {gap} very often , if he would {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : 'cause I had {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : It would have to be attached .
Marketing : They're easy to replace as well , cheap .
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
User Interface : a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a {gap}
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface : and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Mm .
Industrial Designer : Yeah okay .
Marketing : Yeah just a thought {disfmarker} they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Okay , we'll talk about that {disfmarker} so if you finish your {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah that's {disfmarker}
Project Manager : and we'll come back to that .
Industrial Designer : yeah that {disfmarker} that's the end of m my {disfmarker}
Project Manager : That's you , right okay .
User Interface : And just one small question before like you are {gap} , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know .
Industrial Designer : Uh yeah . Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple ,
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate {disfmarker} you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them ,
User Interface : Okay . Okay .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking .
Marketing : I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in .
Industrial Designer : Mm .
Marketing : If we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ?
Project Manager : No .
Marketing : And they kind of respond to the turn of your body . Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display {disfmarker} th uh the remote control display thing .
Project Manager : We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .
Industrial Designer : Um .
Marketing : They don't look at themselves ? Just a thought .
Project Manager : Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah . I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay .
Project Manager : Yeah , no , no .
Marketing : {gap} trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much
Project Manager : Mm .
Marketing : but {gap} maybe we'll leave that one on the side .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : 'Kay .
Industrial Designer : I mean you can {disfmarker} you could do it , you could have a {disfmarker} 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out ,
Marketing : Mm .
Industrial Designer : but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about {disfmarker}
Marketing : Oh I think {gap} forget about the mirror
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay , okay .
Marketing : that was just a very quick passing thought yeah {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Okay , uh would like to share something which I did here . First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white .
Project Manager : Mm .
User Interface : So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . No particular remote is standard .
Project Manager : Mm .
User Interface : Like , some some people have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Here you see this ? This is on a {disfmarker} I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : and g graphic user interface
Marketing : Sorry what does that stand for ?
Project Manager : Which means {disfmarker}
User Interface : basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever ,
Marketing : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : which is {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : If you if {disfmarker} yeah if you have l";yes;4;yes;4;yes;3;yes;3;yes;4;no;0;yes;3
"Project Manager : If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time .
User Interface : Hmm .
Marketing : Is that someone's ?
Project Manager : Is that {gap} .
User Interface : Thank you .
Project Manager : {gap} three , apparently .
User Interface : Hmm . Hmm .
Project Manager : Okay , you all switched on .
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : Yep , me too .
Project Manager : I presume we're good to go . Okay , um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger ,
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor . We wanted a stand-by function . The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . Um {vocalsound} and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . Um {vocalsound} and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . Okay ? Prototype presentation .
Industrial Designer : Is that {gap} for us ?
User Interface : Yep .
Project Manager : I think that would be you .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , shall I show ?
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : I'll show . Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it
User Interface : I can hold it like {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Make sure the camera's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : and I'll I'll show you the presentation .
User Interface : so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Can I just nick your {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yes , yes you can . Wait a second , I'll get it out .
User Interface : {gap}
Industrial Designer : Whoa .
User Interface : It looks
Project Manager : Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Going a bit crazy over here .
User Interface : crazy {gap} .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Thank you .
User Interface : Um not now . Oh .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} You should have one of those things and you can just take it off .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Ta-da .
User Interface : Oh , where are the hinges ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Okay , so
Project Manager : Right .
Industrial Designer : this is our look and feel presentation , the final {disfmarker} our final presentation .
Project Manager : Mm 'kay .
Industrial Designer : And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um
User Interface : 'Kay . You able to look {gap} ?
Industrial Designer : It's gonna have a a plastic body {vocalsound} um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something .
User Interface : Yep . {gap}
Industrial Designer : This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : um which there'd be sort of a wide choice {disfmarker} they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . Um {vocalsound} it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} {gap} .
Industrial Designer : and uh {vocalsound} the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um {vocalsound} how do you say , it's {disfmarker} yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top
User Interface : The black and white touch screen wherein people can {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Mm . So it's flush .
Industrial Designer : and the buttons at the bottom would d
User Interface : Right .
Industrial Designer : so so it'll fully close flat .
Project Manager : Oh right , okay , yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah .
User Interface : {gap} {gap}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} And working on the inside we've um already said {disfmarker} d decided on the kinetic batteries , which {disfmarker} actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of {disfmarker}
Project Manager : So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : 'cause it's the top part that's {disfmarker} okay .
Industrial Designer : Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in {vocalsound} and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Or something . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} And then {disfmarker} yeah . It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : 'Kay .
Project Manager : I'm under the sofa .
User Interface : Ah oka
Project Manager : Or , that would be too complicated .
Industrial Designer : Uh yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . Um the standard , there's {disfmarker} be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about .
Project Manager : Infrared {gap} .
Industrial Designer : Um it would it would have {disfmarker} obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . {vocalsound} And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared um sender would be on the {disfmarker} on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the {disfmarker} we haven't {disfmarker} I don't think we actually put it on .
Project Manager : Like here .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , something like that .
User Interface : Infrared could be here also . Yeah , here .
Project Manager : Okay . Actually , no , it would be {disfmarker} it would have to be on the on the front .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah .
User Interface : {gap} . So when it's {disfmarker} even if it's open here , the signals would go {gap} .
Project Manager : Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . It's still pointing ,
Industrial Designer : So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ .
Project Manager : yes .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah , that would make sense .
Industrial Designer : And then finally um on to the interface . {vocalsound} The top screen , as we said , is {disfmarker} would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen
User Interface : {gap} This one right here .
Industrial Designer : which {disfmarker} yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect .
User Interface : {gap} .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : And now we've {disfmarker} we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .
User Interface : Which is {disfmarker}
Project Manager : But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product
Industrial Designer : No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing .
User Interface : No .
Project Manager : once it's {disfmarker}
User Interface : Look up to it .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics ,
Project Manager : Thank you very much .
Industrial Designer : as that is {disfmarker} that's the company logo {gap} .
User Interface : Yay .
Project Manager : Wrapping it all up , okay .
Marketing : Well done .
Project Manager : Um I've now got evaluation criteria .
Marketing : Certainly .
User Interface : So this is the one . Sorry .
Project Manager : It's to be presented {gap} .
Industrial Designer : There you go . {gap} .
Marketing : Logged in ? Thank you . Oops .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Evaluation . {gap} .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Mm um I I think this is {gap} chip .
Project Manager : It's quite similar to what it was before , though .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : Sorry .
Marketing : This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . {vocalsound} So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those {disfmarker} the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : {vocalsound} The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . {vocalsound} Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Does that seem clear ? Any questions there ?
User Interface : Ah , it's perfect .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : we're going to look at these crite So
User Interface : Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yes ,
User Interface : okay .
Industrial Designer : {gap}
Marketing : we're going to come to {disfmarker} w we'll discuss each one
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : Is that okay ?
User Interface : 'Kay .
Marketing : One is true , seven is false . Right . So I won't write all of that out again . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating . B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ . {vocalsound} This is where I realise how tiny I actually am . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Just write small .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Criteria and rating . Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . How about that ?
User Interface : Yeah , so you can {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah . That works .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay .
Marketing : Okay . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Okay . Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy {disfmarker} it is a fancy look and feel . One is true , seven is false . My own rating for that would be a two . One is true and seven is false .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} I would agree .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh {vocalsound} two {disfmarker} yeah ,
Marketing : I'll just go this way .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : 'Kay .
Industrial Designer : two or three .
Marketing : Two .
Industrial Designer : No , three . Three .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : I would say two .
Marketing : Two .
User Interface : {vocalsound} I would say four .
Marketing : A four , okay .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? Uh two and three quarters , it that right .
User Interface : Almost three .
Industrial Designer : Mm yeah .
Marketing : Two and three quarters ?
User Interface : I think yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah .
Marketing : Okay . Two point seven five , there we go . {vocalsound} Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . I would give that a three .
Industrial Designer : I'd give it a one .
Marketing : Okay . Not that you're biased {vocalsound} in that it {disfmarker} the designer .
Industrial Designer : No , no , not at all .
Project Manager : A two .
User Interface : Oh sorry , I I got it wrong . The first one rating , I'm sorry . Can you just make it two ? The first .
Marketing : The average {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , I I just {gap} it the other way .
Marketing : oh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ? Is that what you're saying ?
User Interface : Uh in {gap} Yep , I just got {disfmarker}
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : {gap}
Marketing : So , I'll work out the average for that again at the end . It's a very slightly altered {disfmarker} Okay ,
User Interface : two point f
Marketing : and we're just waiting for your rating
Project Manager : It's just two point five for that one .
Marketing : f
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Two point five , okay . Losing one decimal place , that's okay .
User Interface : One is a {gap} , seven is false , okay .
Marketing : So what are you rating for this one , Paw ?
User Interface : Two .
Marketing : Two , okay . So that is eight . That brings it down to two ,
Industrial Designer : Two .
Marketing : nice and simple , yeah . Okay , ease of use . Easy to use ? Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true .
Industrial Designer : Two .
Marketing : Two .
Project Manager : I would say a two . I would say a two .
Marketing : A two , okay .
User Interface : Two .
Marketing : Two . I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ?
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} We'll just put almost two ,
Project Manager : One point seven f five .
Marketing : because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places .
Project Manager : Okay , mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Okay . Or we {disfmarker} or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . Um mm now we're looking at
Industrial Designer : D_ .
Marketing : it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours .
Industrial Designer : One . Yeah .
Marketing : Right . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's {disfmarker}
Marketing : Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?
Industrial Designer : No , no , the the base colour was um {vocalsound} white or or like or l sort of a light blue ,
User Interface : White . With {disfmarker} for the plastic ? Uh blue .
Industrial Designer : but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any {disfmarker} basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised .
Marketing : Right .
User Interface : Any {disfmarker}
Marketing : So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do .
User Interface : Right .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , yeah
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Okay .
Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker}
Marketing : And the spongy feel is no problem with that .
User Interface : Yeah , because you'll be having a {disfmarker} Because of the rubber case .
Industrial Designer : No , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that {disfmarker} otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic .
Marketing : Okay . In that case it's got to be a one for me .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I'll give it a one as well .
Marketing : Yep .
Project Manager : One .
Marketing : Everybody ? Okay .
User Interface : One .
Marketing : {vocalsound} That part was nice and easy .
User Interface : Mm .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Okay . Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .
Industrial Designer : Mm .
Marketing : I don't think we've really touched on that a lot .
Industrial Designer : No .
Marketing : We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_
Industrial Designer : It's meant to be .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : it's meant to . Um
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : maybe because it's slightl
Industrial Designer : {gap}
Project Manager : with the size that we've got it's quite small ,
Industrial Designer : {gap}
Project Manager : but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much .
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between .
Marketing : Mm-hmm . Right .
Project Manager : It's quite obvious just big buttons . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing : Right . I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually ,
Marketing : A five , okay .
Industrial Designer : 'cause {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Four .
Marketing : Four and a four okay .
User Interface : Four .
Marketing : Twenty one {disfmarker} is that twenty one ?
User Interface : {gap}
Marketing : So that's four point two five .
Industrial Designer : Yep .
Marketing : And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition ,
User Interface : Voice r recognition .
Marketing : It was the I'm here thing ,
Industrial Designer : yeah .
Marketing : yep . And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} yeah , that's feasible .
Marketing : That sounds good then . I'd go for a {disfmarker} I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or .
Industrial Designer : Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand
Project Manager : A standard .
Industrial Designer : it would be quite loud .
Project Manager : It would be .
Marketing : Right . Okay .
Industrial Designer : So it would be s p
Marketing : You built into the feature .
Project Manager : And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room .
Industrial Designer : yeah .
Marketing : Okay . Logical . That's a one for me .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , one .
Marketing : One
Project Manager : One .
User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing : and one , good .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product ,
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} So ,
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker}
Marketing : how do we feel about this ?
Industrial Designer : {gap} {gap}
Marketing : We've got our our {disfmarker} we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . {vocalsound} Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?
Project Manager : I don't think so .
Industrial Designer : W I thin yeah , I think {disfmarker}
Marketing : We happy to go ahead ?
Project Manager : I think we {disfmarker} yeah . I think we're set .
Industrial Designer : yeah .
Marketing : Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .
Project Manager : Do much apart from having a huge big {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Mm .
Marketing : I know . Okay . Well , I hope that's uh clear to the team . Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up ?
Project Manager : Don't think so .
Industrial Designer : No .
Marketing : Good . Fine then . I'll just leave it there .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay , thank you .
Marketing : Oops .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay ,
User Interface : Hmm .
Project Manager : I've got finance here now . I'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it , if that's okay . Um .
Marketing : Oh yes .
User Interface : You want me to b unplug that ?
Industrial Designer : {gap} {gap}
User Interface : That's all . Yes .
Project Manager : Thanks . Right .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : Now I presume that the screen will go blank ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : that um {disfmarker} Okay . We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . So are we still on for kinetic ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Yes .
Project Manager : Okay . See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . Um it might have influenced our choice . Right , what's happening with the electronics ?
Industrial Designer : It was a regular chip on print
User Interface : Chip on print .
Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Double-curved .
Industrial Designer : Oh , no , no , no , the um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's {disfmarker} you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . In the top , it's the number
Project Manager : Oh , right ,
Industrial Designer : of c yeah {gap} .
Project Manager : okay . Thanks .
Industrial Designer : Yeah ,
Project Manager : So , would there be two ?
Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker} yeah , just a {disfmarker} no , one reg v uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : One chip .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Yep .
Industrial Designer : And they're double curved . No .
User Interface : Single-curved .
Project Manager : One double curve .
Industrial Designer : Y Two ,
User Interface : Two curves , yeah .
Industrial Designer : 'cause it's two .
Marketing : But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . So it can rest .
Project Manager : So what's a single curve then ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I'd say I'd say it was w
Marketing : It would just be a flat bottom with one curve . {gap} like a domed thing .
Industrial Designer : yeah , I think I think it's {disfmarker}
User Interface : Single-cu
Project Manager : So just one double {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : One double-curved .
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : Yeah . Um {disfmarker}
User Interface : {gap} .
Industrial Designer : And one {disfmarker}
User Interface : Plastic and rubber .
Industrial Designer : no , 'cause one {disfmarker} yeah , one's double-curved , and then the other one's
Marketing : The other curves at the sides , but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over . Yeah .
Project Manager : Mm . {vocalsound} Um we've got plastic and rubber ,
Industrial Designer : a plastic .
Project Manager : haven't we ?
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : Plastic one and maybe rubber point five .
Industrial Designer : And special colour .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} .
User Interface : No I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing ,
Project Manager : Um {disfmarker}
User Interface : we can put point five .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : Do you think ?
User Interface : Yeah , I think it allows the point five , yeah . We can use that .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : What does it mean if you put point five for that ?
User Interface : It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic .
Project Manager : It would be like saying we're using {disfmarker} See , it says case material . So
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : we're not actually using plastic in the case , are we ?
Industrial Designer : No , no , that's {disfmarker} it's as an extra .
Project Manager : It's including , it's including .
Marketing : Right , okay .
Industrial Designer : So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get .
Marketing : But it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ?
Industrial Designer : {gap}
Marketing : There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ?
Project Manager : Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay .
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : No , we don't step on anyone's toes . Okay , special colour , do we need that ?
Marketing : Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours .
Project Manager : N yeah , okay . {vocalsound} Interface .
User Interface : Push-button .
Industrial Designer : Yeah ,
User Interface : One .
Industrial Designer : the push-button's one and L_C_ display one .
User Interface : An One .
Project Manager : Buttons {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : And buttons {disfmarker}
Marketing : S
User Interface : {vocalsound} I think we could change the battery also . Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery .
Marketing : Has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ?
Project Manager : Has that not gone up ?
Industrial Designer : Well yes .
Marketing : Is it {disfmarker} oh , it's brought it slightly down .
Project Manager : Oh no , it was seven five it's changed not a lot .
Marketing : So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : is that going to make a difference ?
User Interface : Uncurved , flat .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Oh , it's not made any difference , has it? .
User Interface : No ,
Industrial Designer : No ,
User Interface : it just surprises one .
Industrial Designer : we'll have {disfmarker}
Marketing : It's gone up again .
Project Manager : Oh , it's not calculated it .
Industrial Designer : No , no , you've got to click off to calculate it again .
Marketing : Oh .
Project Manager : Okay , there we go .
Marketing : {vocalsound} It's brought it down slightly .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} It's not a lot though .
User Interface : {gap} . {vocalsound} I don't think so .
Industrial Designer : C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros . It could be in Dollars . And then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve .
Project Manager : We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though ,
Marketing : Is there anything on the menu {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I think {disfmarker}
Marketing : No .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} No .
User Interface : Ri I think it's in Euro {gap} .
Project Manager : Okay , so the highest we've got is the electronics here . Um {vocalsound} and the interface .
Marketing : If we tr um . If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?
User Interface : And going to a regular bat Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , the standard , it {vocalsound} um it would make one difference . The biggest one would be taking away {disfmarker} if you took away {disfmarker}
User Interface : What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery {gap} .
Industrial Designer : If you to
User Interface : It's internal , nobody looks into the battery .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : But shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi
Marketing : And people are used to buying batteries ,
Industrial Designer : If if you take away the voice ,
Marketing : they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control .
Industrial Designer : I I do I don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it .
User Interface : Where's that special form ? Mm mm mm .
Marketing : Should we see what difference it makes ?
Project Manager : Where's the
Industrial Designer : Yeah i yeah .
Project Manager : where's the voice recognition ?
Industrial Designer : No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker .
Marketing : Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Right , okay .
Industrial Designer : If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five .
Project Manager : Well the kinetic is three . If we change it to the battery it's {disfmarker} that's minus three .
Industrial Designer : They {vocalsound} n n yeah , but you p minus three plus two .
Project Manager : Oh , right . I keep seeing zero . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We can do it some other way ,
User Interface : {gap}
Project Manager : we can do {disfmarker} it doesn't have to be voice recognition . We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : You could choose to have that or not .
Marketing : Sure .
Industrial Designer : But they {disfmarker} but I mean in {disfmarker} I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .
Marketing : But we're still working to um head o
Project Manager : So should we just change the design specification then ? {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Make it costly .
Marketing : We can put in our recommendations . If we if we're working to head office specifications as {disfmarker} this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we {disfmarker} the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings .
Project Manager";yes;3;yes;3;yes;2;yes;2;yes;3;no;0;yes;3
"Project Manager : Here we go . Welcome everybody . Um , I'm Abigail Claflin . You can call me Abbie . 'S see . PowerPoint , that's not it . There we go . So this is our kick off meeting . Um and I guess we should all get acquainted {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} Let's {disfmarker} shall we all introduce ourselves ?
Marketing : Hi I'm Chiara , I'm the um Marketing Expert . Um , would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ?
Project Manager : I think we'll get around to that , yeah . So this is just introductions yeah .
Marketing : We'll get round to that later . My name is Chiara and I'm the Marketing Expert .
Project Manager : Okay . I forgot to s say I'm the Project Manager but I figured you all knew that already ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} um so .
User Interface : {vocalsound} I'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer .
Industrial Designer : I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer .
Project Manager : Okay . Um so f here's our agenda for today . Um we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . {vocalsound} Um so . So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . And to do this , we have to {disfmarker} um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . So . We'll get to that . Oh there it is . Right . Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . Um {vocalsound} so we're gonna try out our white board . If we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . Okay .
User Interface : So you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? Or just draw it ?
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : I think both . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah . Both . Yeah {vocalsound} .
User Interface : Okay . Why don't we do both . Right .
Marketing : Who starts ? We ought to decide who starts and {vocalsound} all that . No ?
Project Manager : Any volunteers ?
Marketing : Uh-huh .
Project Manager : Does anyone know what they wanna draw ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Mm , I gotta think about it for a second like . Uh {disfmarker} Does it have to be {vocalsound} functional , trendy and user friendly ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} I don't think so .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Um . Okay , I'll draw . I'll draw one .
Project Manager : {gap}
User Interface : Make sure {gap} my things here . Uh-oh . Right . Okay , my favourite animal is {disfmarker} see . {vocalsound} Oops .
Project Manager : A dolphin .
User Interface : Yeah , it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} 'S like playing Pictionary .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah , I guess it has a fin on top too , yeah . {vocalsound} It's my dolphin .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} So what characteristics do you like about your animal ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : I like its tail .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Um , no , I think dolphins are really uh {disfmarker} I dunno , they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool , like {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} They're graceful .
User Interface : they're graceful yeah , and they're so {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Sleek {vocalsound} .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah they're sleek
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : and they look intelligent and I don't know , they're {disfmarker} I guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing .
Project Manager : I don't know how intelligent that one looks {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah he he doesn't look that smart {vocalsound} . He's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I dunno um they're {disfmarker} I think it's cool the the um {vocalsound} the interaction that or the th things that {disfmarker} the reasons people seem to like you know {disfmarker} you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like {vocalsound} {disfmarker} but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim . {gap} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yes . {vocalsound} Does anybody else wanna draw their animal ?
Industrial Designer : Suppose I can draw an animal , yeah .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Uh-oh there goes the ten .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} It's a cat . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : I don't know . They sleep all day , {vocalsound} they're easy to draw {vocalsound} .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Do you wanna {gap} anything ?
Marketing : Uh yeah .
Project Manager : I dunno if the the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I think the pen is running out of {disfmarker}
Marketing : Well I had the cat as well , but uh I've got a spare one .
Project Manager : ah .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : So I'll use the spare one . Um but it's harder to draw {gap} um .
User Interface : And the pen's dying {vocalsound} .
Marketing : Um .
Project Manager : A horse .
User Interface : Horse .
Marketing : Uh . Um I don't {vocalsound} really know how the legs go ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : That's very good .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : but anyway I will do that . Um , and the main reason is they're pretty . I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . And I like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , I think that's pretty much it . Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {gap} Yeah . This cord's {disfmarker} {gap} Uh . Right . Actually I haven't thought of anything yet {vocalsound} . Uh {disfmarker} It's a pig .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry . What do you think , yeah ? This is {disfmarker}
User Interface : And furry .
Project Manager : yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Textile {disfmarker} tactile , {vocalsound} tactile remote control .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Although {disfmarker} uh I'll just put there . Right .
User Interface : You're dragging a {disfmarker} you have a tail {vocalsound} .
Project Manager : {gap} Oh my gosh , this is disastrous . Sorry about that . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} So moving on . Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro . So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country {vocalsound} . Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .
User Interface : Sorry can you just say that {disfmarker} what's the {disfmarker} what are our price goals again ?
Project Manager : Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro .
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : How many should we sell then ? {vocalsound} Um , a lot ,
Project Manager : Anyone a mathematician ? {vocalsound}
Marketing : two two two million , {gap} two mi no , more f four million .
Industrial Designer : Two million .
Marketing : Four million . And it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .
Industrial Designer : Oh , yeah .
Marketing : {vocalsound} It is a lot . Uh .
Project Manager : So f that's a fifty percent um uh . Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . Experience with remote control . So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .
Marketing : Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : I was thinking that too .
Marketing : bec yeah {vocalsound} bec
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : I think we should design something that has like a {disfmarker} so you can {disfmarker} like somehow like you {disfmarker} I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : I've always wanted that ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : so like {vocalsound} you can push a button on your T_V_ {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah .
Project Manager : I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not {disfmarker} yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .
Marketing : Yeah . And even I think a little light . Um or even a {disfmarker} maybe a vib a vibrating thing . I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah .
Marketing : In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : I don't know if it's expensive maybe to {disfmarker}
User Interface : I don't {disfmarker} yeah I mean it {disfmarker} but like I mean {disfmarker}
Marketing : Maybe call is enough . But yeah .
User Interface : just I mean like your phone even just has so {disfmarker} like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager : What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could {disfmarker} I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . You know like a portable phone has a base ,
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah , or if it had a {disfmarker} yeah .
Project Manager : like just to have a home for it .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
User Interface : Yeah ,
Project Manager : {vocalsound} 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so {disfmarker}
User Interface : I mean {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well that's why it's always in the couch .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah {vocalsound} .
User Interface : Yeah , in in the couch {vocalsound} .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {gap}
User Interface : I dunno , it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah . Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah so we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the project is now couches and remote controls .
Marketing : {vocalsound} But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . But that would really make it more expensive .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Something like that .
Project Manager : Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ?
Marketing : And the other thing is {disfmarker}
User Interface : Bigger .
Marketing : Not {disfmarker} well it needs to be sort of {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Like Hand hand held size , yeah .
User Interface : Hand-sized .
Marketing : Yeah . I don't think you need a {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Not not huge , but {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : But definitely not {disfmarker} well I don't know .
User Interface : It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it .
Marketing : No , it can't be , uh-uh .
Industrial Designer : No it really wouldn't be .
Project Manager : Huh .
User Interface : Or like or like a light thing . You know . I dunno {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} Like spaceship .
User Interface : . Yeah {vocalsound} . Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : That would be really {disfmarker} I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop .
Project Manager : Little homing device . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . Uh .
Project Manager : Okay . So what do we think this remote control should {disfmarker} Five minutes .
Marketing : Oh dear .
Project Manager : Till the meeting {disfmarker} oh right . This is what we have left . Um , oh we just {gap}
User Interface : I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I agree .
User Interface : 'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything .
Marketing : Yeah , yeah yeah .
User Interface : I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So .
Project Manager : You {disfmarker} what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . Like the way a mobile phone does .
User Interface : That would be cool .
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah . I mean it just seems like {disfmarker}
Project Manager : So you could like um {disfmarker} like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can {disfmarker} the way you do it on your radio is that you uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : yeah .
Project Manager : what do you call it {disfmarker}
Marketing : Select . Uh .
Project Manager : s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s
Marketing : But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen .
Project Manager : That's something we could decide . Mm .
Marketing : Because {disfmarker}
User Interface : I guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno .
Marketing : Because , I don't know if it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think it's e expensive , if you have {disfmarker} if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote ,
Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah .
Marketing : and then use the telly as a screen .
Project Manager : Right .
Marketing : But um {disfmarker}
User Interface : I'm thinking kind of {disfmarker}
Marketing : But yeah for sure . Something like not {disfmarker} it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : is that what you mean ?
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Right . Mm .
User Interface : Or like you h you see those you know people {disfmarker} I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those {disfmarker} these things that at their house you know {disfmarker} their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that {disfmarker} and it's like a hand held like {disfmarker} turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like {disfmarker} so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if {disfmarker} it must be {disfmarker} it would probably {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno .
Project Manager : Mm .
Marketing : But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap .
User Interface : Yeah , yeah . Yeah that's true .
Project Manager : Yeah . I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point {disfmarker} twelve fifty for {disfmarker} to actually make the device .
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : Mm .
Project Manager : Um but it's something to think about , yeah .
User Interface : Well , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah .
Project Manager : I mean we'll have to see how much that would be .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Or some {disfmarker} it i we can find out probably on the internet {vocalsound} how much it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Um . Yeah , and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : What was the word ?
User Interface : Furry .
Marketing : Water resistant .
Project Manager : Oh I was just {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : No but it's {disfmarker} I thought , ah , spot on .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot .
User Interface : Yeah . Mm , mm .
Marketing : That's quite annoying .
Project Manager : Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : like that's another {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , clip . Ooh {vocalsound} . Um .
Project Manager : Um . We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . Um . So . Yeah . The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah I think so .
Project Manager : yeah {vocalsound} um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . The something , what is the U_I_ ?
Industrial Designer : User .
Project Manager : Yeah , what does it stand for again ?
User Interface : That's me . Uh , User Interface design .
Project Manager : User Interface Designer . So that's gonna be more technical . I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w
User Interface : So technical function .
Industrial Designer : The working design is the structure .
Project Manager : Yeah , yeah .
User Interface : What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Um , I guess you'd have to find out {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {gap}
Industrial Designer : Um .
Marketing : It says on that email but it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : It was in the email .
User Interface : It does but it {disfmarker} I just don't really {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I wrote down what mine were .
Marketing : It said um {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : It said {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound} What effect should the thing ha should it have , okay . Alright .
Marketing : Yeah
User Interface : And working design .
Marketing : like {disfmarker}
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : Be a medium between you and the telly I think ,
User Interface : Yeah , yeah . Alright .
Project Manager : Mm .
Marketing : that's uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : And how it works , okay . Right . I'm I'm on task .
Project Manager : And the M_E_ , what does that stand for {vocalsound} ? M
Industrial Designer : Marketing .
Project Manager : Marketing , right . Um {vocalsound} .
Marketing : Marketing . Oh it's written here , but um .
Project Manager : So we'll be working on the user requirements , um {disfmarker} Yeah .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : So I guess that wraps it up . I'll see you all in thirty minutes . I just did .";yes;4;yes;4;yes;3;yes;2;yes;3;no;0;yes;3
"Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : 'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . Welcome everybody . Um hope your sessions went well . Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . Right . Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this {disfmarker}
Marketing : And I can start if you want . Mm .
Project Manager : sure .
Marketing : Is there an order ? No .
Project Manager : Hm ?
Marketing : We haven't decided on an order .
Project Manager : No , any any order's fine . Yeah .
Marketing : First . Okay . Um , how do I put this {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Just uh {disfmarker}
Marketing : I'll just put the cable in .
Project Manager : Oh yeah , sorry .
Marketing : {gap} Is that it ? Can you see ? {vocalsound} Oh , here . Okay . So what happens it doesn't work ?
Project Manager : It sh it takes a few seconds I think .
Industrial Designer : You may need to {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Who's that ? {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : No .
Industrial Designer : But sometimes you have to do it {disfmarker}
Marketing : Is it in the right thing ?
Industrial Designer : it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight .
Marketing : Oh wait , um . Uh . You need to help me . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Uh-huh , and then press function .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : and F_ eight .
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : Could you just plug it back into hers because she had {disfmarker}
Marketing : Oh , wait .
User Interface : oh .
Marketing : That's {disfmarker} is that it ?
Industrial Designer : Adjusting .
Project Manager : Here we are . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : The cable might be a little loose or something . Oh , you got it .
Marketing : Right here we are .
Project Manager : Oh . Is it on ?
Marketing : We're here .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue .
Project Manager : Hm .
Marketing : Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . {vocalsound} And that's all I have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um .
Project Manager : 'Kay .
Marketing : Shall I {disfmarker} what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ?
Project Manager : Yeah . Just move right on .
User Interface : Right . So get this . Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ?
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Uh function F_ eight .
Marketing : Function F_ eight .
User Interface : 'Kay . What's function ?
Project Manager : It's the little blue {disfmarker} w it's the one {disfmarker} th
User Interface : Oh function , I see it .
Project Manager : yeah . Yeah should be {disfmarker}
User Interface : There we go . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : It should be {gap} yeah .
User Interface : Okay . Um . This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um {vocalsound} just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet {vocalsound} .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : And okay so basically um {vocalsound} I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . Um {vocalsound} so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that {disfmarker} like close together that um {vocalsound} are used in the same way , uh {vocalsound} or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh {disfmarker} can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um {vocalsound} does it do {disfmarker} or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but {disfmarker} And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . {vocalsound} Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . {vocalsound} That concludes my presentation .
Project Manager : {gap}
User Interface : Okay . You need the little thingy . Ooh .
Industrial Designer : How do I um {disfmarker}
Marketing : S That's on view .
Industrial Designer : Right .
Marketing : Oh .
Industrial Designer : Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation .
Project Manager : 'Kay .
User Interface : Do you know about like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Mm ?
User Interface : I dunno , you seem like you know about {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here .
User Interface : Okay . Cool . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Okay . Well thank you everybody . Um {vocalsound} we have {disfmarker} we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something {disfmarker} I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay . Um . So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . Um , yeah . {vocalsound} Do {disfmarker} Let's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can {disfmarker}
User Interface : Like in terms of
Marketing : How it looks or {disfmarker}
User Interface : how it looks , or like what it does ?
Project Manager : wha what {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So .
User Interface : Yeah . Okay . So {disfmarker} Is our target group then people {disfmarker} so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?
Project Manager : {vocalsound} I think that seems to {disfmarker} yeah . Mm .
User Interface : So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : It's easy to implement .
User Interface : Okay . So the {disfmarker}
Marketing : {gap} the the buzzer you mean ,
User Interface : yeah , yeah , yeah .
Industrial Designer : Locator .
Marketing : yeah , for sure , yeah .
User Interface : So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range ,
Project Manager : Yeah , teenagers and young professionals .
User Interface : what was it ?
Marketing : Well that's for speech recognition .
Project Manager : Oh , uh .
Industrial Designer : Well {disfmarker}
User Interface : Oh .
Marketing : And screen . That's only for speech recognition and screen .
Industrial Designer : I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one ,
Marketing : Yeah yeah yeah .
Project Manager : Mm .
Industrial Designer : or {disfmarker} it seems like a silly ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : I mean {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I'm not sure how you would implement it .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : I just put the values {vocalsound} in .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : And if if you consider our budget , it probably {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : But um the screen is the same as what , {gap}
Industrial Designer : It's a cool idea but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah , I'm happy with that .
Project Manager : Yeah {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Right so um {disfmarker} yeah .
User Interface : Hu yeah .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Completely .
User Interface : Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a {disfmarker} like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself .
Industrial Designer : Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place {gap} since the T_V_ already has power .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone .
User Interface : Okay . Okay .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably .
User Interface : Alright .
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Okay .
Project Manager : So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote {vocalsound} .
Project Manager : right . Yeah , yeah .
Marketing : So do you plug it in the T_ {disfmarker} you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button .
Marketing : Okay . Okay .
User Interface : So it's now like a two-part thing .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , so it would be a two part package .
User Interface : Okay . Alright .
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : So we get to design that too .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Make it fashionable . Um , okay .
Project Manager : So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals .
Industrial Designer : Yeah I think so .
Marketing : Yeah . Just there .
Project Manager : Huh . Okay .
Marketing : Mm . Are we um should that thing be on the {vocalsound} thing to put the {disfmarker} you s you talking about a home for it .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ?
Project Manager : We probably leave that . I mean I guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's {disfmarker}
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : Yeah . Then it can live anywhere .
Project Manager : Yeah {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Okay . For the {disfmarker} so you have that button , that {disfmarker} so there's {disfmarker} is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ?
Industrial Designer : Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ?
Marketing : Are we just having a radio ? On the phone .
Industrial Designer : Um it seemed like a {disfmarker} a beep seemed the most reasonable to me ,
User Interface : T
Marketing : You don't need a light . Yeah yeah yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : I think that's what the phone has ,
Marketing : Yeah yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it {vocalsound} and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever .
Project Manager : And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so
Marketing : You can hear it's under the couch yeah .
Project Manager : {disfmarker} yeah .
User Interface : So i Yeah .
Marketing : Um , {vocalsound} {gap} So need the other buttons . So we have this {disfmarker} mm .
Project Manager : So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them {vocalsound} , yeah you you did um ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : That was that was me .
Marketing : Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : they're {disfmarker} I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television .
User Interface : I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes .
Project Manager : Oh really . 'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities .
User Interface : And uh
Industrial Designer : Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across {disfmarker} international ?
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : They're not {disfmarker} no .
Marketing : They're not , no .
Industrial Designer : Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s .
User Interface : S
Project Manager : Yeah , that's right , yeah .
Marketing : {vocalsound} It not V_H_S_ here ?
Project Manager : But D_V_D_ probably is .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , other than that region and coding thing .
User Interface : Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days .
Marketing : But V_C_R_s {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , for sure .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : Yeah . So . Okay , let's see if I can {disfmarker} I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Well for sure we need the um {disfmarker} I think we can just design the channels ? I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much ,
Project Manager : S
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Huh .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : s and it's usually that red
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : You know , I've seen some remotes that {disfmarker} where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just {disfmarker}
Marketing : Oh okay , yeah .
User Interface : It seems like that would be hard though .
Project Manager : But {disfmarker}
User Interface : I mean , like because unless you know {disfmarker}
Project Manager : It might be confusing . Yeah .
User Interface : yeah . Just 'cause I wouldn't {disfmarker} I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah . Besides you like to be able to go power .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I never think to hold something down . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} I have the power {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah . B {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager : I guess . So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Right .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Well even um iPod thing {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of
User Interface : That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah .
Marketing : scrolling {disfmarker} I don't know .
Project Manager : Mm . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah . Because people li seem {disfmarker} now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no {disfmarker} Know you don't have one two three four five {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , yeah . I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool ,
Project Manager : Mm .
User Interface : it's it's funny like you f like I just {disfmarker} I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and {disfmarker} it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah yeah , it's just {disfmarker} and it's one thing which has everything .
User Interface : Yeah , and it is {disfmarker} yeah . It is really {disfmarker} but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ?
Marketing : Well can't it tell the {disfmarker} like can't you {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner .
User Interface : Yeah . Okay .
Marketing : you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button .
Project Manager : Oh that's gonna {disfmarker} Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of {disfmarker}
User Interface : Like a disc . Yeah . Yeah . It's like {disfmarker} it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad .
Project Manager : okay . I've never used one . No .
Marketing : It's like l this {disfmarker} like that , and then you do that .
Project Manager : Okay . Okay .
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah and then .
Marketing : And then you can have um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing {vocalsound} like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus .
User Interface : Okay . So like it's like a little part of the circle that {disfmarker} Or it {disfmarker} oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , you can {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Well i
User Interface : zap .
Marketing : Yeah , click o actually click on to have {disfmarker}
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well .
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah . So volume could be like the top it and the bottom {disfmarker} So do you need to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Doesn't it rotate though ,
User Interface : okay .
Industrial Designer : so it'll be moving around .
User Interface : Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like {disfmarker}
Marketing : What do you mean the function ?
User Interface : I mean like okay , 'cause so {disfmarker} I dunno , I guess {disfmarker} Okay {disfmarker} so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : But then {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : so if you wanna switch to the {disfmarker} to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down .
Marketing : Yeah but it knows for some reason .
User Interface : It just {disfmarker}
Marketing : The iPod knows .
User Interface : It just kno {vocalsound} the iPod knows . {vocalsound} S
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} If it works on an iPod then it works .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Huh .
User Interface : Yeah . So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want .
Industrial Designer : I don't have one .
Marketing : Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up .
User Interface : Okay . That's what I mean . Okay . Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down .
Industrial Designer : Oh .
Project Manager : So it's like holding {disfmarker}
Marketing : And then {disfmarker} well if you do that it goes , but if you {disfmarker} like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen .
Project Manager : You can {disfmarker} o And you you {disfmarker} is there an extra actual button ? Or are you actually {disfmarker} you're just using the mouse to go up and down .
Marketing : Well what you {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Like {disfmarker}
User Interface : It's like a b
Marketing : for the iPod you press an {disfmarker} w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Right . Mm-hmm .
Marketing : But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ?
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Like you could just have {disfmarker}
Marketing : I don't know ,
Project Manager : Oh , like {disfmarker}
Marketing : you could click and then have it up and down ,
Project Manager : Oh you could actually {disfmarker}
User Interface : Like {disfmarker}
Marketing : but I think {disfmarker}
User Interface : I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod .
Marketing : Yeah yeah yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah {vocalsound} .
User Interface : But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be {disfmarker} is that part of {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Is that what makes them expensi I think it's all of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I don't think so .
User Interface : yeah , I dunno , I dunno .
Project Manager : they have so much memory though , that's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker}
User Interface : You don't think so ? Okay .
Industrial Designer : I don't think it's the wheel dealy .
Marketing : I think it {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah . I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they {disfmarker} it can hold what like five thousand songs or something .
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} .
User Interface : Yeah . I'm thinking we could {disfmarker} if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know .
Industrial Designer : And they're re-programmable aren't they ?
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : You can put on your songs and then put on a different set ,
Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : S
User Interface : Yeah . Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah yeah yeah . Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . Because , the other thing , I didn't tell you all my presentation {vocalsound} , is that people find it {disfmarker} find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : and that's another thing they complained about .
Project Manager : Mm .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Um , what other buttons were there ? Volume {disfmarker} oh we've ts just said that .
User Interface : So okay .
Marketing : Channel selection .
User Interface : This is just for T_V_ , it's not for {disfmarker} or it is {disfmarker} does need to be compatible with {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I {disfmarker} A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things .
User Interface : So how do you switch {disfmarker}
Marketing : Menu .
Industrial Designer : and menu maybe . Oh yeah .
Project Manager : So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next {disfmarker}
User Interface : Okay . So like if we had that {disfmarker}
Project Manager : But we'll hold off on that 'cause {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : But s yeah uh .
Marketing : But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote .
User Interface : That's true , yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : So , I know I'm not c really clear on what {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch .
User Interface : Yeah , yeah .
Marketing : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Project Manager : Mm . Mm .
User Interface : So you'd have to have like {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : I think {disfmarker} you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can {disfmarker} you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons .
User Interface : Yeah ,
Marketing : Yeah , it is only fun
User Interface : but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad .
Project Manager : But i Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Oh . But I think the circle only does {disfmarker} channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah but it {disfmarker} it would be {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch .
User Interface : So {disfmarker} but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're {disfmarker} if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different {disfmarker} I mean do we need to think about that ,
Project Manager : Um , yeah , let's think about it
User Interface : that like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yes we can try that .
Project Manager : 'cause we need to wrap up .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}";yes;4;yes;4;yes;2;yes;2;yes;4;no;0;yes;3
"Project Manager : Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . Um {vocalsound} .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Alright we're moving on to conceptual design .
User Interface : {vocalsound} 'Scuse me . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Bless you .
Project Manager : Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . Um , {vocalsound} under marketing we targeted our audience , and {disfmarker} Um , yeah . That was {vocalsound} generally {vocalsound} {disfmarker} how helpful that was .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're {disfmarker} Right , um {disfmarker} So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what {disfmarker} where you've come from our last time . Does everyone have presentations ?
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Yes .
User Interface : Yes .
Project Manager : Would anybody like to go first ?
Industrial Designer : Sure .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : So I've been looking at the components design . Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .
Project Manager : And why not wood ?
Industrial Designer : And ,
Project Manager : And why not wood ? {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : hmm ? {vocalsound} Uh , well we can use wood . {vocalsound} I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . So that's what I've got on design .
Project Manager : 'S good .
Marketing : Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material
Project Manager : Hmm .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : which is quite shocking .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Ha . Mm . Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the {vocalsound} is the current trend
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . Um . For fashion , we go for fashion .
Project Manager : Mm .
Marketing : The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to {disfmarker} I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : but that's just a personal opinion .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : I think
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ?
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Um , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find {disfmarker} come up with a solution that's better than mine . Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Thank you for your attention .
User Interface : So .
Project Manager : I think it's the next {disfmarker} it's the blue one , yeah .
User Interface : Oh , uh , there we go . {vocalsound} Uh . Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} I actually wasn't aware of the {vocalsound} new trends in electronics
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : and and uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing : Neither was I . Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um {vocalsound} fabrics . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh {disfmarker} Okay , alright anyway . Um {vocalsound} here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying {disfmarker} we're gonna try to talk about , um {vocalsound} what kind of uh {disfmarker} how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . {vocalsound} Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of {disfmarker} I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ?
Project Manager : Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time .
User Interface : 'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this {disfmarker} it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um {vocalsound} the wheel
Project Manager : You need a screen for it ?
User Interface : you {disfmarker} it seems like you would need a screen .
Industrial Designer : You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . So {disfmarker}
User Interface : But like if you think about it {disfmarker} yeah but if {disfmarker} so is it just {disfmarker} okay . So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ?
Project Manager : We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ ,
User Interface : Are we {disfmarker}
Project Manager : that was one of th I I was {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : sorry ,
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : I I meant to update you on that . Um .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Alright . Okay .
Marketing : But the screen can come up on the telly , the {disfmarker} she said .
User Interface : Okay . Okay .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : That correct ?
User Interface : So anyway if {disfmarker} well we just {disfmarker} we need to {disfmarker} Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I was thinking {disfmarker} okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna {disfmarker} I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a {disfmarker} right .
Marketing : Graphical interface ?
User Interface : Yeah like you're g
Marketing : Uh on the {disfmarker} you can have it on the telly though .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can {disfmarker} okay we're not choosing that , I guess . But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : So that {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} people seems to be {disfmarker} well {disfmarker}
Project Manager : You've {disfmarker} Yeah , I know what you're saying , you have to {disfmarker}
User Interface : You know . But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um {vocalsound} I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because {disfmarker} So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if {disfmarker} or or {disfmarker} then again if you just {disfmarker} I guess {disfmarker} I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on .
Marketing : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , yeah .
Project Manager : But but imagine someone with s
Industrial Designer : My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ .
User Interface : I oh yeah ?
Project Manager : But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : 'Cause you'll have to like {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : They have to r wheel really fast .
User Interface : but you can quickly s you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Industrial Designer : at least on theirs .
User Interface : Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um {disfmarker} So you're either {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . Like if you just wanted to go to like {disfmarker} from five to six you could tap or someth
Project Manager : Right .
User Interface : And then there's also the concern about you know um {vocalsound} how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um {vocalsound} you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that ,
Project Manager : Yeah I mean with that many options , you'd {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} I'd think that the screen would be better ,
User Interface : like {disfmarker}
Project Manager : because you could have that menu option , sort of {disfmarker}
User Interface : I would think so too , like {disfmarker} So I mean {disfmarker} and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : but then again it would {disfmarker} it does make kind of {disfmarker} if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : It's more expensive according to the design people .
User Interface : m yeah .
Project Manager : Uh . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah , that's the only thing though .
Industrial Designer : You have to get a {disfmarker} an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal .
User Interface : Yeah . So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Mm .
User Interface : {vocalsound} You can get to {disfmarker} you know , you can {disfmarker} Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can {disfmarker} it brings up like the menu on the T_V_
Marketing : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Project Manager : Mm .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : So the T_V_ is the screen , that {disfmarker} yeah
User Interface : yeah , yeah .
Project Manager : So it would have all these different options of changing
User Interface : Yeah . But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up .
Project Manager : to {disfmarker}
Marketing : Look it even has settings .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Hmm ?
Marketing : On the {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} you can just take theirs and just {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : but um {disfmarker} 'cause that just {disfmarker} it does seem like , it {disfmarker} that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but {disfmarker} I dunno , and then {disfmarker} so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Um , right . What if {disfmarker} I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : or whatever we're thinking . I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? Or {disfmarker}
User Interface : It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ .
Project Manager : Yeah . So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah definitely .
Project Manager : okay .
User Interface : Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : I mean it it needs to be easy to {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah but should be comfortable .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : I mean how do how do {disfmarker} I'm not really {disfmarker} Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah I use it like that .
Industrial Designer : W when we had the wheely remote control , we {disfmarker} it was on the top I think , if you held it like that .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : But , were there buttons on there as well ?
User Interface : Yeah , so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do .
Project Manager : Mm . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So we just used the top part .
User Interface : Mm yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , so {disfmarker} but I mean I think it could be pretty small .
Marketing : Uh .
User Interface : Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that you can {disfmarker}
Project Manager : What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? Like you {disfmarker} so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it .
User Interface : But can't you just get {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Do {disfmarker} do you know what I'm talking about though ? Like , uh , yeah just something {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of {disfmarker}
User Interface : K
Marketing : Well you can have it on the settings ,
Project Manager : Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah .
Marketing : no ?
User Interface : Yeah , But , I mean , do you need that ? If if you can get to , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen .
Project Manager : Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : is is {disfmarker} if w I {disfmarker}
User Interface : That keeps it
Project Manager : if we can do this , that'd probably be {disfmarker}
User Interface : really {disfmarker} Yeah . Uh you wouldn't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I just don't think you would even need it .
Project Manager : Yeah , yeah .
User Interface : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this {disfmarker} how they actually programme these things , and if that's {disfmarker}
User Interface : Mean {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ?
Project Manager : yeah . I mean it {disfmarker} would y would {disfmarker} that would be {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I don't know .
User Interface : I mean you can do it ,
Marketing : They already do it .
Industrial Designer : I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote .
User Interface : you {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it doesn't seem that hard . I mean I've never bought a remote .
Industrial Designer : I'm not sure .
User Interface : It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Well they usually are .
User Interface : which is a little {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Well {disfmarker}
User Interface : My {disfmarker} I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know .
Marketing : No .
Project Manager : Huh .
User Interface : But um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I guess that's right . It always comes with the T_V_ . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : So , um {disfmarker} but I mean it's {disfmarker} I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , it {disfmarker} most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something .
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Well so {disfmarker} So , do we need {disfmarker} I dunno . Well I guess we have to you know think about {disfmarker} But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Yeah . Okay .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : That's what it does anyway .
Marketing : But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you {disfmarker} like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : you don't know they mean , yeah , it's like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : and I never get it .
Project Manager : yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Never ever .
User Interface : So , but {disfmarker}
Marketing : So {disfmarker}
User Interface : oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ?
Marketing : Well on the telly .
Industrial Designer : Or on the T_V_ too .
User Interface : On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those {disfmarker} like okay now I hit this {disfmarker} you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .
Project Manager : Mm . And it is technologically innovative in a way ,
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : so that fits with the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah . I guess . And it is trendy , the iPods are {vocalsound} really hot right now , so {disfmarker}
Project Manager : B Yeah .
Marketing : Did you did you get that pc picture on {disfmarker} did they provide you with that picture on the web ?
User Interface : Um , yeah , by web research , yeah , so {disfmarker}
Marketing : That's quite interesting . What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Oh god . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Oh , I was gonna say .
User Interface : Oh .
Industrial Designer : You said uh people want spongy .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Um , one of your {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's {gap} in like those stress ball things . So , that would be spongy .
User Interface : Oh , okay , that would be cool .
Project Manager : Ah .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : Mm . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Just nice feel , but I hate spongy .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , c that's e that would be kind of {disfmarker} oh , you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing .
Project Manager : Yeah . I mean definitely the area round it .
User Interface : But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : so you're like {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Yeah I think it could work .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Or what if we integrated the {vocalsound} the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana .
User Interface : a vegetable . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Well it could be like mobiles that just {disfmarker} you just put a cover .
Project Manager : An orange . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah .
Marketing : If it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : which frankly I'm not particularly fond of ,
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : You know you had {disfmarker} there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles .
Industrial Designer : You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah . You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : And it could {disfmarker} the colour can fit your sitting room ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have {disfmarker} well I don't know . Um .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : So what if {disfmarker} what
User Interface : So I think {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker}
User Interface : yeah , colours .
Project Manager : I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is .
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Is that kind of {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : I {disfmarker} 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Um {disfmarker}
User Interface : Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : I do I dunno . Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just {disfmarker} the feedback we've just got about the {disfmarker}
Marketing : Maybe a ball .
Project Manager : A ball ?
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Know , a squashy ball .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} A relaxing squashy ball . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That you can p
User Interface : That's in the shape of a fruit , like a {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : well I {disfmarker} see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : and I'm thinking how do you change the hard {disfmarker} would you put a um sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a {disfmarker}
Project Manager : This is just {disfmarker} Okay . Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy .
Marketing : Oh , okay , yeah . Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : That {disfmarker} see I was thinking this s
Marketing : Which is cheaper .
Project Manager : sorry {disfmarker}
Marketing : Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually .
Project Manager : I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing .
Industrial Designer : Oh . Mm .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : And like this {disfmarker} you could have like you could have like cherries and {vocalsound} things around there .
User Interface : Oh I like that shape .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I was thinking sort of a single ball shape .
Project Manager : I was thinking if it was like this {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer : So you're holding a squishy ball
Project Manager : 'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : and then it has a {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .
User Interface : It's like it has to be s
Project Manager : It's almost like your thumb is farther up ,
User Interface : yeah {vocalsound} .
Project Manager : so if if you could squish it lower then {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah I guess so .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah . So it wouldn't be very big in either {disfmarker} like how big ? This big , and then you just do that , I suppose .
Project Manager : Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah .
User Interface : What if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can {disfmarker} so so maybe one you know {disfmarker} you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : and you could get {disfmarker} you could have your choice , you know ?
Marketing : Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy , like a a cover .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : But {disfmarker} well the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that ,
User Interface : Yeah , yeah .
Project Manager : Mm .
Marketing : and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : No .
User Interface : Oh .
Marketing : Um . That's nicer . I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Hmm . Well that's not very neat , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Marketing : Um .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah . I mean I think uh {disfmarker} and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely {disfmarker} So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part .
Marketing : If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your {disfmarker} to the way you hold it .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Yeah you could squish it .
Marketing : If it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you {disfmarker} it it just moulds to your hand .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah . So where are the fruit and vegetables now ?
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath .
User Interface : Fruits and veg .
Marketing : We we don't know . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : And the rest is the co";yes;4;yes;3;yes;2;yes;2;yes;4;no;0;yes;4
"Project Manager : 'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of {vocalsound} our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think {disfmarker} looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um {vocalsound} so actually I think {disfmarker} Yeah um f {vocalsound} you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Okay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your {disfmarker} to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes {disfmarker}
User Interface : You could change the vegetable , or fruit .
Industrial Designer : yeah , I can change the vegetable .
Project Manager : Oh is that broccoli ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : This one's broccoli {vocalsound} .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . This is a mango .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : The {disfmarker} it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : You don't have orange , you have mango . Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : 'S a very bright strawberry . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .
User Interface : It's been a l
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Oh yeah .
User Interface : And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was {disfmarker} or design yet actually , would be the um thing {disfmarker} the locator . How how {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Well the locator is just chip that's inside there .
User Interface : Okay so that's just {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere
User Interface : So you have to have a button on your on your {disfmarker} you have to attach the button to the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah we didn't design that .
User Interface : Yeah we have {disfmarker} that that has yes yet to be designed .
Industrial Designer : But it would be coordinating with that of course .
User Interface : Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : So . Tada .
Project Manager : Oh . Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . Um the only one that's in there , production costs . And if you open it up . Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there . {vocalsound} But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I said uncurved or flat . I think that's what you have there , is that right ? For the for the plastic part would be {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes .
Project Manager : Oh . Okay .
Industrial Designer : But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and {disfmarker} d I dunno what that means .
Project Manager : Right .
Industrial Designer : One side is curved and then the other side is curved .
Project Manager : Well {disfmarker} yeah . If we're talking about the area just {disfmarker} oh I d I dunno . I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um so what else ? There's plastic for that area around the button . Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ?
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Um and lots of special colours actually . {vocalsound} Uh scroll wheel . Do you see anything that I've missed ?
Industrial Designer : No I think that's alright .
Project Manager : Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : And if we sold a lot of squishy things .
User Interface : Mm .
Project Manager : Boo yeah . Okay . {vocalsound} S So {disfmarker} Mm . Did y what did you work on ? The {disfmarker}
Marketing : Um evaluation criteria .
Project Manager : Okay . Do you wanna {disfmarker}
Marketing : I've got a presentation .
Project Manager : Okay . I think that's {disfmarker}
Marketing : So I need {disfmarker} where's the cable ? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . Um . Right . This doesn't {disfmarker} okay . Um the method is {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is {disfmarker} everything's listed down . Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And {vocalsound} we we have therefore in total um {disfmarker} We have five {disfmarker} we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Um . No . This is the table . Can you see this here ?
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Um so the que the questions I've given you {disfmarker} c could you write that down ? True is one and and false is seven . And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . Um . I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told .
User Interface : Yeah . Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own {disfmarker} {gap}
Marketing : Yeah it's in the um {disfmarker} it's in the project documents .
User Interface : Is it meeting three minutes ? No it's not minutes .
Marketing : It's called evaluation criteria .
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : And it's under evaluation .
Project Manager : Huh , the PowerPoint one ?
Industrial Designer : Hmm ?
User Interface : Okay . Cool .
Marketing : Yeah . You've found it all ?
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : So it was um {disfmarker} Yeah true's one .
User Interface : True's one and false is seven .
Marketing : Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ?
Project Manager : Um we can do it separately and then discuss it
Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah okay .
Project Manager : if if that's what people wanna do .
User Interface : So it's actually a scale .
Project Manager : Wait , one is true and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} Um ,
Project Manager : so these are the questions we're answering . And one is {disfmarker}
Marketing : yes it's {disfmarker} if it's fancy you put one ,
Project Manager : One , right okay .
Marketing : if it's really unfancy it's seven .
Project Manager : If it's somewhere in between you put four .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah , something .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay .
User Interface : Okay . {vocalsound} Does it feel fancy ?
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Feels like play-dough .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound}
Marketing : They shouldn't really be questions . Should be more like {disfmarker} Are the batteries easy to insert ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : I'm gonna say yes . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yes ? Very very true . Okay .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I imagine they're somewhere on the front . We have a little case that you slip 'em in .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : Are we just about ready ?
Marketing : Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . Do we {disfmarker} um is it necessary ?
Project Manager : I don't think so . It's {disfmarker}
Marketing : We'll just do um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay .
Project Manager : Our animals will forever be there .
Marketing : Yeah . Okay .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Un unless you feel you need it t to {disfmarker}
Marketing : I don't feel any {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : okay okay .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : We'll {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : right um {disfmarker} Right so one point one ? We'll just go in a circle .
Industrial Designer : 'Kay
User Interface : One .
Industrial Designer : Five .
Marketing : Right . Ooh I don't know .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Right . One ?
Industrial Designer : Five .
Project Manager : Five .
Marketing : Five .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Two . Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? Is that what the company does ?
Project Manager : I I think we should {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} It's four if you wanna do that .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah ?
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : It adds to sixteen , so that's four .
Marketing : Oh no . It adds to thirteen . One five five two .
Industrial Designer : Oh I thought she said five .
User Interface : Hmm .
Marketing : One five five two is thirteen , over four for now . I think that's um {disfmarker} next ?
User Interface : Um three .
Industrial Designer : Six .
Project Manager : Six .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Really ? {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Two .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} I wasn't cheating I swear .
Marketing : Uh-oh . Right . One point three is {disfmarker}
User Interface : So it's a one was true and seven was false ?
Project Manager : Uh .
Industrial Designer : Huh ?
User Interface : {gap} Okay , so you guys really didn't like it ?
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Oh I thought it was the other way round .
Industrial Designer : Wait a minute .
Marketing : I really {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I thought it was the other way round too .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} So we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing : Well uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Sh Yeah I I was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top {vocalsound} .
Marketing : Yeah yeah . It was one is true and {vocalsound} false is seven .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : I should've kept the table up .
Project Manager : Oh gosh . Okay . Well {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I'll just I'll just reverse them all . It's no problem .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Right , well I'm glad this came out .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I thought you guys hated it . {vocalsound}
User Interface : I was like , why did you guys design it that way if you hated it ? {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} Oh that's quite funny {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Marketing : Okay . {gap}
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Okay . So , starting again , one point one ?
User Interface : One .
Industrial Designer : Say two .
Project Manager : Three .
Marketing : Two . Okay , one point two ?
User Interface : Uh three .
Industrial Designer : Two .
Project Manager : Two .
Marketing : Two . Okay . Um , one point three ?
User Interface : One .
Project Manager : One .
Industrial Designer : One .
Marketing : Ha . {vocalsound} Two point one ?
Project Manager : Two .
User Interface : Uh two .
Industrial Designer : Uh two .
Project Manager : Two point {disfmarker} I think I missed two . {vocalsound} Wait , is that two point one ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : One point four , one point five . Okay right
Marketing : Oh dear , okay . Sorry .
Project Manager : that's {disfmarker} I have two of them .
Industrial Designer : Mine has all kinds of problems .
Marketing : Two and one .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Sorry about that . T two point two , which is one point five .
Project Manager : One .
Industrial Designer : Uh three . Wait why did I put three ?
User Interface : Uh one .
Industrial Designer : I meant one on mine too .
Marketing : Okay . Three point one . Is that correct on my slide ?
Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah ?
User Interface : Uh one .
Industrial Designer : Three point one . I have four .
Project Manager : Three .
Marketing : One , four , three , three , three point two ?
Industrial Designer : Three .
Project Manager : Three .
User Interface : Uh . One .
Marketing : Three point three .
User Interface : One .
Industrial Designer : One .
Project Manager : Two .
Marketing : Four point one ?
User Interface : One .
Industrial Designer : Two .
Project Manager : Five .
Marketing : Two . Four point two .
User Interface : Two .
Industrial Designer : Three .
Project Manager : Four .
Marketing : Two and four point three .
Industrial Designer : Two .
Marketing : One , two .
User Interface : One .
Project Manager : Two .
Marketing : Right so I put one on that .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue .
Project Manager : Okay . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing : Or is it tedious ? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone .
Project Manager : No no that's um {disfmarker} I think we should look at the ones that {vocalsound} like where s where people said four , where {disfmarker} um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote .
Marketing : I didn't know how else to do it . Okay . Well the worst ones were three point one .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Do {disfmarker} does every ones have the slide ?
Project Manager : The {disfmarker}
Marketing : Three point one .
Project Manager : that was material .
Marketing : Slide show . Material {vocalsound} technologically innovative , okay . Um ,
Project Manager : Mm .
Marketing : do you want to change it ? What are the suggestions ? I don't know , anyone ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um {disfmarker}
User Interface : Which one is that again sorry ? Three point one ?
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Yeah that {disfmarker} it's three point one was not that good . Four point one .
Project Manager : Does the shape {disfmarker}
Marketing : The shape .
User Interface : I think {disfmarker}
Marketing : Four point two ?
Project Manager : See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the {disfmarker} is it uh gonna be the size , like the the controller ? It {disfmarker} or bigger ?
Industrial Designer : I think the wheel would probably be {disfmarker} mm .
Project Manager : Because {disfmarker}
User Interface : What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ?
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : And like then it {disfmarker} you could hold it in your hand better .
Industrial Designer : I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . They're kinda smallish .
Project Manager : Yeah . No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get {disfmarker} that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : The flat one . Yeah .
Project Manager : so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position .
User Interface : I didn't {disfmarker} yeah . But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . Mm .
User Interface : But it's still too big I think , in your hand . Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah . And would it even resemble fruit that way ?
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah like certain ones {disfmarker} you'd have to limit the fruit selection ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : like you could probably do a strawberry still .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : I think the broccoli would be out .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : You could do {gap} , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like {disfmarker} sorta like a joystick .
Project Manager : Yeah that I I {disfmarker} when you were holding that before , it actually looked {disfmarker} yeah .
Marketing : Yeah . That looked really good .
User Interface : I don't know . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ?
User Interface : Uh .
Industrial Designer : Not that I can think of . Rhubarb . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Rhubarb .
Marketing : {vocalsound} I think that broccoli is my favourite actually .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} These obscure fruits .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Uh despite the {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound} I think we needn't {disfmarker}
Project Manager : What if um the {disfmarker} it was just patterns on like {disfmarker} we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber .
User Interface : Huh ?
Project Manager : You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah .
User Interface : Oh okay .
Industrial Designer : So it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry .
User Interface : Yeah . That could work .
Marketing : Yeah . {gap}
Project Manager : Or I mean we could even have fruit like around {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : I mean {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah . I dunno .
Project Manager : But if we if we need {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah and just have the colour match or something .
Project Manager : yeah . And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah . 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously .
Project Manager : Mm . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : Or like {disfmarker} I dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think {disfmarker} see as like {disfmarker}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : like you could {disfmarker} if it was only this {disfmarker} you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable .
Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface : So like maybe that's just too big
Project Manager : Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that ,
User Interface : because {disfmarker}
Project Manager : which is a nice kind of {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah it's sorta like a joystick .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : yeah . But {disfmarker}
User Interface : {gap} I dunno .
Project Manager : I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ?
User Interface : I guess {disfmarker}
Project Manager : 'Cause like kind of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits .
Project Manager : Yeah , yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Or like even {disfmarker}
User Interface : Dif
Industrial Designer : We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough .
Project Manager : Or even like {disfmarker} Yeah like you said , like a joystick like that . You know ?
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Like uh we could do {disfmarker} I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .
Project Manager : 'Cause that , I think {disfmarker} I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : And you still have the comfort of holding it like that .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : Mm .
Project Manager : And you could {disfmarker} like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Alright .
Project Manager : But I mean it {disfmarker} do we have any other ideas about that ?
Marketing : Um {disfmarker}
User Interface : We could tr I don't know .
Marketing : Think the critical ones came out to be {disfmarker} yeah that one . {vocalsound} . Batteries easy to insert for some reason ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : which can be easily {disfmarker} I think that's not a problem any more .
Project Manager : The batteries are going in the back ?
Industrial Designer : That {disfmarker} everyone gave that a one or a two . Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote .
Marketing : No .
Project Manager : The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one {disfmarker} I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door ,
Project Manager : no you could {disfmarker} Just like any other one . Okay . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : yeah um like on a normal remote .
Project Manager : Right .
Industrial Designer : So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : I think everyone's under three anyway .
Project Manager : Mm .
Marketing : So I think it's {disfmarker} yeah those are the only two points .
User Interface : Cool . Well {disfmarker} Yeah the broccoli I guess wins .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Um , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} We were a bit off task .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Um so uh I can't think of any {disfmarker} So we'll have to like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mm .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah I dunno . You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like ,
Industrial Designer : It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .
User Interface : but you could do like {disfmarker} Yeah that's true .
Project Manager : Yeah . And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular .
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah that's true . Mm .
Industrial Designer : I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too .
Project Manager : Yeah . Which is why printing might be like {disfmarker} just printing the fruit on {disfmarker} {vocalsound} fruit .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Hmm .
Project Manager : Mm . {vocalsound} Not really {disfmarker} Well we've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . {vocalsound} Um so project evaluation .
Marketing : Do you want this and we can all {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No .
Project Manager : I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied {disfmarker} oh , oh it's alright . Uh . Yeah .
Marketing : It's alright yeah ?
Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Sure .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : I did .
Project Manager : I mean fruit and squishiness . How c more creative can you get ? {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Sponginess . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : The prototype making was very creatively stimulating
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria {vocalsound} .
Project Manager : And how was our leadership and teamwork ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : I think it was good . We knew what we were doing . It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute .
Project Manager : Well I thought my leadership was crap personally .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Excuse me , am I allowed to say that ? Yeah . {vocalsound} Um .
User Interface : I think you were fine .
Project Manager : Yeah , well I'm never gonna do a management position , I know that now .
User Interface : You did a good job leading .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um yeah , I thought we all worked very well together .
Marketing : Yeah we didn't {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} uh it all c sort of blended quite well .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like {vocalsound} I don't know , all had ideas about it but {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah . Very democratic . No spats , that was good .
User Interface : {vocalsound} yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : No . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Um and the means for like {disfmarker} the materials we used , how convenient were they ? Like the the pens , the whiteboard ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : I mean we used {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff .
Project Manager : Are you a Mac person ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : No no I never touch Macs either .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things .
Project Manager : Huh .
User Interface : Hmm .
Marketing : Which isn't very user-friendly though . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} Well the problem is if you don't {disfmarker} like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it . So I have all these documents I can't use now . But yeah I mean I guess it's okay .
User Interface : I felt like my {disfmarker} I dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh I di I thought that my {disfmarker} the information that was available to me was kind of just like {disfmarker} or maybe it was just the idea that we had . But there's kinda {disfmarker} it was kinda like okay , I don't really think {disfmarker} I dunno what I'm doing here .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Mm .
User Interface : So I didn't really think it was helpful . So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally , {vocalsound} think it's kinda stupid .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . I never use it .
User Interface : Yeah but uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I can't say I found everything particularly helpful . Like I {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : It didn't really {disfmarker} yeah .
Project Manager : It {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works .
Marketing : I though it was brilliant no ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Really ? {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think .
Project Manager : I mean m my problem {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah it probably does .
User Interface : So like a f
Marketing : I think it depends on the role
Project Manager : yeah , yeah .
User Interface : Yeah I think so .
Marketing : no ?
Project Manager : 'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like {disfmarker} they'd put {disfmarker} send you to sites and stuff right ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : See I couldn't do that , so I didn't really know what you guys were doing . And when you were talking about it I was just like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things ,
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : 'cause I {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control .
Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .
Industrial Designer : As if you'd wanted to .
Marketing : Yeah . But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um
Project Manager : System . Yeah .
Marketing : a whole system ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : 'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah I mean , it {gap}
Industrial Designer : Well I think it's interesting how it all went together , like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah , huh .
Industrial Designer : It seems planned you know .
Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah I kinda thought that um {disfmarker} I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : because {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time . But um {disfmarker}
Project Manager :";yes;4;yes;3;yes;2;yes;2;yes;3;no;0;yes;3
"Project Manager : So we can start ?
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Suppose I have to do my presentation . {vocalsound} Eh um {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Ah okay . It's Ada Longmund ?
Project Manager : {vocalsound} So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager . So um we will have to um speak about m the project . Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly . Record . So the project method is the following . So if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . Uh .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : The tool training is to try out the white board , so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Maybe someone ha we have to {gap} this whiteboard ,
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : yeah ?
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Maybe you can draw your favourite animal
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : and make a list of its favourite characteristics .
Marketing : So right now ?
Project Manager : I don't know if we have to do it now , maybe later later .
User Interface : So yeah I think you can do it . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I don't know .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Twenty five Euros ?
Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : I think it's quite good price , yeah .
Industrial Designer : I it's it's reasonable , s quite {disfmarker} yeah . Twenty five .
Marketing : It's reasonable , I think , yeah .
Project Manager : And uh
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : it will uh be a an international remote control ,
Industrial Designer : Is {disfmarker}
Project Manager : as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . So , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um {disfmarker} with the remote control . Um just uh maybe be imaginative with {vocalsound} remote const con controls ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : try to create something new and people would like to to buy . And {vocalsound} and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know {disfmarker} I suppose you know what you have to do . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah . I I hope so {vocalsound}
Project Manager : And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .
Marketing : Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yep .
Marketing : and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I_D_ ,
Marketing : okay .
Project Manager : yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I_D_ is for the Industrial Design , yeah ?
Marketing : Okay .
Industrial Designer : And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer ,
User Interface : That's me .
Marketing : Okay ,
Industrial Designer : yeah ?
Marketing : and Marketing Expert , it's me .
Industrial Designer : AMI yeah project .
Project Manager : So I will manage all all the group .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} you will be the manager {vocalsound} yeah {vocalsound}
Marketing : You can manage all this , yeah .
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : Good .
Project Manager : So you have questions ?
Marketing : Um . Not really .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} So
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager : you all know what the parts of the work you have to do .
Marketing : So which {disfmarker} you , the Industrial Designer .
User Interface : No I'm user interf I'm user interface design .
Industrial Designer : I am the Industrial Design , yeah
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : And you ?
Industrial Designer : I am the Industrial Designer so .
Project Manager : Mm okay .
User Interface : Okay . So what's the difference between
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : user interface design d industrial design ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Hmm .
Marketing : I mean , you have to know . Ah , you have to know it .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} It's difficult . {vocalsound}
Marketing : It's your job , so I hope you you know what it is .
Industrial Designer : You know very soon . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah , I think so .
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker}
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it .
User Interface : Okay , so I make uh u user interface .
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : You you de you implement the core functions in the {disfmarker}
Project Manager : And i maybe you will transform it {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer : I I think the user the user interface design is {disfmarker} he will design how the user will you know {disfmarker} the relation between the user and you know the remote control so {disfmarker}
User Interface : Use it . Make make {disfmarker} yeah .
Industrial Designer : And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like .
User Interface : Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . So the materi
User Interface : I design the user f user interface , you design the function .
Project Manager : Maybe , it is the outside and the inside .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Okay .
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Okay right . But {disfmarker} I was thinking that he's a user {disfmarker} 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know .
User Interface : Yeah yeah .
Industrial Designer : But I don't know . {vocalsound} Okay .
Marketing : Well . You know .
Industrial Designer : I'm the industrial designer .
Marketing : Oh , okay , okay . Not the other one .
Industrial Designer : So .
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Okay . So and the marketing expert will {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have
Project Manager : And {disfmarker}
Marketing : and then thi this would {vocalsound} I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer .
Project Manager : yeah .
Industrial Designer : Ok Okay .
Project Manager : And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product . So you don't have to do something really specific ,
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : as everybody everybody will have to use it ,
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : it's sor the same as keyboards . You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and U_K_ keyboard ,
User Interface : Yeah . Mm .
Project Manager : so really the remote control to be international .
User Interface : Yeah . Okay .
Project Manager : And not too expensive .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : Yeah . And uh simple .
Project Manager : As we want to maximise the benefit .
User Interface : And easy to use .
Marketing : And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty , so .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah , you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros .
User Interface : Ah , yeah .
Industrial Designer : It should be {disfmarker}
Marketing : That's the problem .
User Interface : Okay . Okay .
Project Manager : And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Okay . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : So , is it okay ?
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Mm . It's clear .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} There was a step about drawing something in the in the board , I don't know .
Marketing : Yeah , maybe should go and draw an animal .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Is it ? {vocalsound} Are we supposed to do right now ? {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah yeah , you try . Try first . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Oh right it's it's from the left to the ri {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : So
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : you think we have to do it now ?
Industrial Designer : I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now . {vocalsound}
User Interface : You can draw something which is very simple . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : You want me to draw something ?
Industrial Designer : Oh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Product manager {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Everybody {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : okay , let's go ,
User Interface : Oh , maybe we should bring Kemy here .
Project Manager : I will try .
User Interface : Kemy is really good at drawing . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Many {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I think everybody should do it , so .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} It's not matter {vocalsound} So .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : You're going to draw ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : Uh it's the same as mine .
User Interface : {vocalsound} What's this ?
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} yeah . It's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's a cat .
User Interface : It's a fat cat . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} It is not a fat cat . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : It's the fat cat , okay .

Marketing : Jus
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : everybody has to grow {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : Oh . Okay , I draw . The only thing I can draw is like this . Oh . Oh . Oh .
Marketing : A duck .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} You love the eyes .
User Interface : No . {vocalsound} What's this ?
Industrial Designer : What are you {disfmarker} I don {vocalsound} no idea , so {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah , that was the eyes .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : A clown .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Rabbit .
Industrial Designer : It's a rabbit .
User Interface : {vocalsound}

Project Manager : It's a rabbit .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh yeah . Bugs Bunny one .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Okay .
Industrial Designer : It's not so bad so .
User Interface : The only thing I can draw , because it's very simple . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Okay . I go .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : What ? Oh . So what else ? This was my favourite one ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} So you don't have a {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Thank you . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} A fish .
Marketing : Right . A fish .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} That's a that's a fish ?
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Okay , let's try to draw something .
Project Manager : You forgot the chips .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Oh yeah , doesn't look so fine .
Industrial Designer : Have to be really careful .
Project Manager : Fish and chips . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} Okay ,
Industrial Designer : Ah {vocalsound} it's my turn .
Marketing : it's your turn .
User Interface : Oh . Okay , be careful .

User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Of
User Interface : No problem , no problem .
Industrial Designer : So , what can I draw some more ?
Project Manager : Oh {gap} . {gap} ?
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} ? No . Mm {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , it's it's a se it's my priority this one . Yeah .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : A person ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} No . It's a really crazy dog {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Oh yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Dog . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Marketing : Good .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Okay .
Industrial Designer : Transfer . It's a dog in a village . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} So what are you sug going to do now ? {gap}
Marketing : I think it's done .
Project Manager : Yeah , I think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : It's done ?
Project Manager : yeah .
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : Just have to {disfmarker} present project ,
User Interface : So we have break .
Project Manager : discuss a little bit about it .
Industrial Designer : Oh my God .
Marketing : Oh , we have twenty five minutes for the meeting .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : So , if you have questions .
User Interface : Oh . Hmm .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Know what time is it ? No .
User Interface : No . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : It's okay ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah , it's okay .
Project Manager : You know your job ? you know your job ?
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} We have an idea yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : You know your job ?
Industrial Designer : I have an idea of my job {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} yeah so . Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : Good .";yes;4;yes;3;yes;3;yes;1;yes;2;no;0;yes;3
"Project Manager : So , I will open our functional design meeting .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : So , I will play role of the secretary . As also Program Ma Manager . So , we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um
Industrial Designer : Industrial Design .
Marketing : Marketing Expert .
Project Manager : What's your talk ?
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : Marketing Experts . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Mm .
Project Manager : And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : Um , so you're participant two ?
Industrial Designer : One one .
User Interface : No no no .
Project Manager : No you're {disfmarker}
User Interface : One .
Project Manager : No ,
Industrial Designer : Three three , it's three
Project Manager : I'm participant one . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : sorry {vocalsound} .
User Interface : I I think I'm a {gap} .
Project Manager : Okay , never mind .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : 'Kay , did you save your presentation ? {vocalsound}
User Interface : In one .
Industrial Designer : In one , sorry {vocalsound} .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Isn't that technical functions ?
Marketing : No sure .
Industrial Designer : So you didn't save it maybe .
Marketing : Uh
User Interface : It's mine .
Marketing : it's David Jordan . Course .
Industrial Designer : Alright , so {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Name's Jordan . So
Industrial Designer : David Jordan ? {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .
User Interface : Mm yeah .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : so I'll {disfmarker} I let David Jordan do his presentation .
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : No , no . Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think .
Project Manager : Uh .
Industrial Designer : Too great for email then .
User Interface : Okay , so . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : Uh I I will focus on user interface design .
Project Manager : Mm .
User Interface : Um so move to the next slide . As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very {disfmarker} has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . There's a lot of functions . Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control . So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? Um , let's move to next slide . Um . Yeah . So I {disfmarker} so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . A very good example is Google . As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . Um so move to next s slide .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller {vocalsound} which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : That's the end of the talk {vocalsound} the end of the presentation .
Project Manager : So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .
User Interface : Uh {disfmarker} With sophisticated functions ,
Project Manager : So powerful ,
User Interface : but with very {disfmarker} yeah powerful .
Project Manager : many functions and very easy to use .
User Interface : Yes . Yep .
Marketing : So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both ,
Industrial Designer : To merge the two system huh .
Marketing : I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : You mean this one ?
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose .
Industrial Designer : Mm yep .
Marketing : {gap}
Industrial Designer : But But this is {disfmarker}
User Interface : But if we have very very good user interface
Marketing : Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : and then {disfmarker}
User Interface : it take less time for user to learn how to use it .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah you {disfmarker} maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are {disfmarker} or almost the same , so the sign .
Project Manager : Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same .
Marketing : Oh it should {disfmarker} okay , yeah . The user should know .
Industrial Designer : So you have to {disfmarker} The sh the user there {disfmarker} for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that {disfmarker} So .
Project Manager : Yeah um such as maybe the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah . So .
Project Manager : Go on , go back and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .
Marketing : Yeah , that's gonna be the trick . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah , that's my job . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} That's your job {vocalsound}
User Interface : That's my job . It's not the easiest I've got to .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : It you {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager : So , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use .
User Interface : Yep .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Powerful and easy to use .
Marketing : So that's the point .
User Interface : Yeah , that's the point .
Project Manager : So , next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things .
Industrial Designer : Okay , okay .
Project Manager : So you you're {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Participant two . Yeah .
Project Manager : Um . Okay .
Marketing : {gap}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} The rationale must be {vocalsound} design , or {disfmarker}
Project Manager : So , Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer . Okay .
Industrial Designer : So we can move to the next slide . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . So , this one is leather bu based
Marketing : Mm .
Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker} I propose a nifra infrared base {vocalsound} you know , so so for me I think that it is better {vocalsound} it's bet it's better to control T_V_
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know {disfmarker} For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to {disfmarker}
Marketing : True .
Project Manager : So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ?
Industrial Designer : I think it's cheaper than laser , so {vocalsound} .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : Yeah . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? Twelve , nearly thirteen ,
Marketing : What the cost is ?
Project Manager : yeah . The cost {disfmarker}
Marketing : Twelve , twelve a half .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I think for the cost we want {disfmarker} for the cost we want {vocalsound} {disfmarker} it's better to have uh uh Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : and the bulb it will be somewhere inside .
Marketing : That might just {disfmarker} So .
Industrial Designer : You can go to the next slide .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : I have some kind of pictures you know , here . You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .
Project Manager : What is this ?
Industrial Designer : This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Look . But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and {gap} .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : So and the next slide , it is the last one it's {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I think it should be wire {vocalsound} wireless re remote con {vocalsound} Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ?
Marketing : What's the average price of this technology then ?
Industrial Designer : Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the
User Interface : So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire {vocalsound} with remote control ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} You'd {disfmarker} yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : So you think that uh {vocalsound} a cable between the remote control {vocalsound} and the T_V_ {vocalsound} {disfmarker} won't be a good idea .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Okay . Okay .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} No it wou maybe it will be cheaper {vocalsound} I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu
Marketing : But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah ,
User Interface : {vocalsound} Wireless remote control {vocalsound} .
Project Manager : but {disfmarker}
Marketing : I don't think {disfmarker} well , yeah , I don't think he would ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know ,
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : but in a sense {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : sometime I want to have wire because you know .
Project Manager : Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?
Industrial Designer : {gap} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ?
Industrial Designer : Uh , {vocalsound} I don't {vocalsound} think it will be too much .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Could you answer please ? {vocalsound}
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's {disfmarker} I think that you know you can always you know {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so .
Project Manager : Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : The wire ?
Project Manager : As it's {disfmarker} yeah .
Marketing : Yeah . True .
Industrial Designer : Okay , yeah .
Project Manager : I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Uh that's my job . That's the {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay , {gap} I'm sorry .
Marketing : Now the {disfmarker}
Project Manager : So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because {disfmarker} even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the {vocalsound} the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} So
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : just think of um the usability .
User Interface : Design a wireless remote control . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : I think it's would be easier to have {vocalsound} a link between the remote control and the television ,
Marketing : Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True .
Project Manager : yeah .
Marketing : This you will see in my presentation then .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} So I will let you to do your presentation , so .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Okay {vocalsound} .
Marketing : Which is participant four . So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . We've made a study , so could you go to next slide .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Sorry for the functional recurrence . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's {disfmarker}
Project Manager : You mean the loo the look , the outside ?
Industrial Designer : The look , how it look like .
Marketing : Yeah , the the look is is bad for them
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : so uh it's your job , David , maybe . Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so {disfmarker} doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay . Could you go next slide ? Uh , so as you said uh ,
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : So this is from the experiments we've done ,
Project Manager : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing : so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} What is R_S_I_ ?
Marketing : R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um {disfmarker} doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager : Ah um okay . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide . Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons ,
User Interface : Functions .
Marketing : this would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Marketing : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ?
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Sure ? Yeah ?
User Interface : Yeah , I think possible . Because we can {disfmarker} We can uh mix uh several function in one button .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : So lets you {disfmarker} then you have less buttons .
Project Manager : Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ?
User Interface : But I'm not sure {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .
Marketing : Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the
Industrial Designer : The manuals .
Project Manager : Yeah ,
Marketing : manual .
Project Manager : I think the {disfmarker}
Marketing : It's {disfmarker}
User Interface : No you you can have a switch menu , so you can
Project Manager : Yeah , but it has to be intuitive .
User Interface : well for example {disfmarker} Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions .
Project Manager : Yeah , okay . Okay ,
User Interface : Then you you put the switch button ,
Project Manager : but {disfmarker}
User Interface : then it switch to another category of functions . Yeah . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder .
Industrial Designer : With a {disfmarker}
User Interface : So there's a different functions , but i if you you {disfmarker} there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . So we can has less buttons .
Project Manager : Yeah , but {disfmarker}
User Interface : But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny {disfmarker} look fancy , not funny .
Industrial Designer : Look fancy .
Marketing : {gap}
Industrial Designer : This is a question that should be asked to the {disfmarker} If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people {gap} .
User Interface : Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know .
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah , this is something we sh
User Interface : Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some {disfmarker} for other peoples , so .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : But this was first step and {disfmarker} This was the first step , yeah .
Industrial Designer : I think the solution is to have many colours of {disfmarker} you know instead of having one grey standard {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .
Marketing : Specially distribution , yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , maybe . Yeah , maybe .
Project Manager : If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .
Marketing : Uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , personalised colour . Because you know {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , it will cost little bit more .
User Interface : Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
User Interface : some people prefer black remote control .
Marketing : Yeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so .
Project Manager : And also f
User Interface : Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options ,
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : so user can select which colour they prefer , so .
Project Manager : Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases ,
Marketing : Yeah ,
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : remember it's twelve Euros .
Project Manager : and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Hmm .
Project Manager : And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : So {disfmarker} I think you have quite lot of points to to think about
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : and to discuss it with uh the other members .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , hmm .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ?
Marketing : Yeah , it's done , just {disfmarker} yeah . If we would {disfmarker} if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Okay . Mm so {disfmarker}
Marketing : So .
Project Manager : So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's {disfmarker}
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : It's is uh {disfmarker}
Marketing : Lame , or {disfmarker}
Project Manager : No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .
User Interface : Mm-hmm . Yeah .
Project Manager : So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control ,
Industrial Designer : Yep .
Project Manager : and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not {disfmarker} you won't be uh {disfmarker} you won't had {vocalsound} um buttons to just to manipulate {disfmarker} yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that .
User Interface : Control . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing : Mm-hmm
Project Manager : because if we want to to do remote control
User Interface : Mm .
Project Manager : which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . Is it okay ?
User Interface : Okay . But there's balance between function and the cost .
Project Manager : So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .
User Interface : Yeah . Okay .
Project Manager : And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product .
User Interface : Mm-hm .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : of the uh of real reaction
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : So .
Project Manager : and uh also {disfmarker}
Marketing : So has to be yellow .
Industrial Designer : Yellow .
Project Manager : Yeah . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .
User Interface : Okay . Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Require lot of requirements ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} For cheap {vocalsound} remote control , yeah .
Project Manager : but {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah . And cheap .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : A low cost .
Project Manager : Yeah . But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : This is {disfmarker}
Marketing : I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway .
Project Manager : Maybe not ,
Marketing : It's maybe more in browsing .
Project Manager : but mayb
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .
User Interface : Yeah , there's that box in uh o of it .
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : Ok
Marketing : Hm-mm .
User Interface : It's It's not so uh popular now . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know
User Interface : Mm .
Industrial Designer : the global usage ,
User Interface : Global ,
Industrial Designer : so if people don't have the technology .
User Interface : okay .
Project Manager : So .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : So everybody is okay with the new requirements ?
User Interface : So I I so {disfmarker} As as for the colour , what what do you think ?
Project Manager : I think it has to be yellow .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yellow ? Do you think that people like the colour yellow ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yellow ? {gap} T_V_ remote control ? {vocalsound}
Marketing : Min
Project Manager : Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised .
User Interface : Okay . Okay .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be .
Project Manager : Why you go {disfmarker} It has to be fashion .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , so . Doesn't need to be completely yellow ,
Project Manager : So you have to {disfmarker}
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : but just mm .
Project Manager : Yeah . It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society . Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . Think it's a re reaction remote control , so .
User Interface : Okay , okay . Okay .
Project Manager : And also it has to be attractive , of course ,
User Interface : Mm .
Project Manager : because if you want to sale {disfmarker} to sell the remote control . It's okay ?
Marketing : Regarding the first line , what {disfmarker} So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : And that's it .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : But {disfmarker} I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me .
Marketing : It's already changed for {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I think it would be simpler .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Okay . So {disfmarker} I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break . And you will have in thirty minutes individual work . Uh {disfmarker} Y you {disfmarker} You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um {disfmarker} pon
Marketing : Industrial Designer .
Industrial Designer : Industrial Designer , yeah . Component component , yeah .
Project Manager : yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : And Florent to work my subject .
Marketing : Yep .
Project Manager : And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : It's okay ?
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : I think the um session is closed .
Industrial Designer : Good .
Project Manager : And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder . {vocalsound} Not in mine .
Industrial Designer : Okay {vocalsound} Okay , that's clear .
User Interface : Okay {vocalsound} . Okay . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Should be better . {vocalsound}";yes;4;yes;3;yes;2;yes;3;yes;4;no;0;yes;2
"Project Manager : {vocalsound} So let's start our second me meeting on {vocalsound} conceptual design .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : So ,
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : as the previous meeting I will be the secretary
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh {disfmarker}
Marketing : No y you do the minutes first , or ?
Project Manager : What ?
Marketing : No ?
Project Manager : I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : Yep .
Project Manager : So , we'll {disfmarker} S
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : technical accessoire ?
User Interface : No no no .
Project Manager : Interface ?
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : This .
User Interface : Mm . So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um
Industrial Designer : Mm .
Marketing : Mm .
Industrial Designer : A nice one .
User Interface : attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} I'm not sure the one in the middle {vocalsound} is very attractive .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah , it's very , you know
Project Manager : {vocalsound} It's very big ,
User Interface : if you're {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . {vocalsound} Or to recognise it ,
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay .
User Interface : yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah , why not . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager : We'll have big discussion I suppose after that ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager : so .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart ,
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we {disfmarker} I think we can attract a lot of user .
Project Manager : Okay . Something else ?
User Interface : Okay . No . There {disfmarker} this is the three concepts of our controller .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , {vocalsound} you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition ,
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager : but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ?
User Interface : Yeah , so {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ?
User Interface : Y
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe .
Project Manager : or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ?
User Interface : Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .
Project Manager : Yeah , sure .
User Interface : For example , if you cannot find your uh {vocalsound} controller , you can just uh {vocalsound} just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two .
Project Manager : I
Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , {vocalsound} that's a good {disfmarker} that's a good point , so .
Project Manager : That's true . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : One and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : So you can use your gesture . That's no problem . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah but how how is {disfmarker} how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?
Project Manager : Broken arm ?
User Interface : For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very {disfmarker}
Marketing : Okay . Okay .
Project Manager : Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yep . {vocalsound}
Marketing : But this this {disfmarker} but this would never happen anyway .
Project Manager : Why ?
User Interface : Yeah , they cannot speak at the same time .
Project Manager : If you have one brother and one sister
Marketing : Yeah {disfmarker}
Project Manager : and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme ,
Marketing : Yeah , but the {disfmarker}
Project Manager : so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah but {vocalsound} Yeah
User Interface : Yeah , it's very interesting . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah but this {disfmarker}
Project Manager : so .
Industrial Designer : but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : because the {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah ,
Marketing : I don't think it {disfmarker}
Project Manager : but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} That's right .
Project Manager : You're not you're not obliged to share it .
Marketing : Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff .
Project Manager : Yeah , we can {disfmarker} yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . Even you h you have the controller , I can {vocalsound} I can say channel three ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} it's {gap} {vocalsound}
Marketing : No .
User Interface : so it's c come to channel three ,
Marketing : No , but this is disadvant disadvantage .
User Interface : I don't have to {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage .
User Interface : It's advantage .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to
Project Manager : Yeah , but one other question .
Industrial Designer : manual controllers , eh .
Project Manager : How how much will it cost ?
Industrial Designer : No , more expensive maybe .
User Interface : How much ?
Project Manager : Yeah . Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working .
User Interface : No no we we d we we just are use um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Some some efficient .
Marketing : Uh if you if if you use the basic {disfmarker}
User Interface : No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field .
Project Manager : So you think it won't cost an {disfmarker} Not a lot for us ? Or ?
User Interface : Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , but uh uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : it's uh {disfmarker} yeah . It's {disfmarker}
Marketing : But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . Because then you need uh {disfmarker} I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example .
Industrial Designer : Well y y you have also the language problem ,
User Interface : No it's uh {disfmarker} Even for the f um because the the vocabulary {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : you know when you {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Mm-mm .
Industrial Designer : 'Cause it it have to be universal ,
Project Manager : Yeah . I agree with uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : so .
User Interface : The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : remote control . We need something that is international . Suppose we're {disfmarker} we want to sell it in France .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : The recognition system will be able to understand French . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : so .
User Interface : Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our {disfmarker} the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation
Marketing : Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah but you know . The product {disfmarker} The pro
User Interface : mechanism . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Mm , okay .
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah ,
Project Manager : And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?
User Interface : it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . But {disfmarker}
User Interface : Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed .
Project Manager : Yeah , but how will you {disfmarker}
User Interface : So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one .
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : If you have the language , you have to develop for each country .
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : Oh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but for each country you have to do one ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : because uh the for example for Se {vocalsound}
User Interface : Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Oh really ? {vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Oh .
Marketing : Yeah ,
Project Manager : Seems to be quite complex .
Marketing : but then w Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : Comple
User Interface : No , it's not so complex {vocalsound} .
Marketing : we have to take care of the twelve Euros
Project Manager : And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ?
Marketing : problem .
Project Manager : And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ?
User Interface : No no no it's not {disfmarker} I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . It it just {disfmarker} the microphone is embedded in the controller .
Project Manager : Yeah , but where is the controller ?
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : Where is the controller ?
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : It's in your family , in your home . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah , but we're {disfmarker}
Marketing : No , but then it's it's like this uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : here it's uh an object . But here you say you want to use i uh s technology .
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here .
Industrial Designer : A microphone maybe .
Project Manager : Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .
Industrial Designer : To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe .
Project Manager : You just want to interact with television .
User Interface : Yeah yeah just {disfmarker} you just put the controller here , then you
Industrial Designer : I if you say one , he switch to channel ,
User Interface : you use your command
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : yeah .
User Interface : and you do s your gesture .
Project Manager : but you can lose it . {vocalsound}
User Interface : No no it's n y {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you lose it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay you {disfmarker} so you can build a kind of black box
Industrial Designer : Devic
Project Manager : and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone {vocalsound} inside your remote control .
Project Manager : Ah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : But you would still have the buttons . Or is it {disfmarker} do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ?
User Interface : think it {disfmarker} we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think {disfmarker}
Marketing : Okay , so you {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah ,
User Interface : yeah .
Marketing : yeah .
User Interface : You can see {disfmarker} they can switch form one modality to another .
Project Manager : Mm .
Marketing : Yeah , I dunno . It's a bit risky risky .
Project Manager : I think so .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : No ,
Project Manager : And maybe it will be quite {disfmarker}
User Interface : that's quite inter quite attractive .
Industrial Designer : But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so {disfmarker} although y y
User Interface : Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah but i i {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}
Marketing : I dunno .
User Interface : We should have confidence in technology . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , we should . {vocalsound} Uh .
Project Manager : Hmm . So , what do you think ? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer .
Industrial Designer : Mm .
Marketing : What ?
Project Manager : Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?
Marketing : If if {disfmarker} I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition .
User Interface : More features , yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but {disfmarker}
Marketing : But if if if it like doubles uh
Industrial Designer : I think he need a control that is very reliable ,
Marketing : no one would would be interested .
Industrial Designer : so .
Project Manager : So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Hmm ?
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Just want to have something {disfmarker} controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ?
User Interface : Yeah but if if you stick to um {disfmarker} stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah . No ,
User Interface : Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that {disfmarker}
Marketing : I mean {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : It's not really the {disfmarker} we
Marketing : Y
Industrial Designer : we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so {disfmarker} or something like that . But uh I think a user need {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function ,
Marketing : No ,
User Interface : but {disfmarker}
Marketing : but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something ,
Industrial Designer : Don't have a {disfmarker} the the {disfmarker} Yeah
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : if we can send email from it .
User Interface : But it's not the {disfmarker} only the problem {disfmarker} only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ .
Marketing : No . No .
Industrial Designer : Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if {disfmarker}
Marketing : Cause for example {disfmarker} yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller ,
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah , but uh we want so
User Interface : but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .
Marketing : Yeah , you wou you would {disfmarker}
User Interface : That's {disfmarker}
Marketing : True .
User Interface : the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our {disfmarker} from other products .
Project Manager : Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .
Industrial Designer : Yeah {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} And for all the person of the family maybe ,
User Interface : Yeah , uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : You don't need to tune it .
Industrial Designer : so , yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?
Project Manager : Yeah , why not ? If it's {disfmarker}
Marketing : I mean , for example the goo y
Industrial Designer : Because you have new {disfmarker}
Marketing : you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller .
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah .
Marketing : I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . Google is {vocalsound} is simple , works fine ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot .
User Interface : Yeah . Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller .
Marketing : Uh thi this {disfmarker} I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition
User Interface : The {disfmarker} then nn
Marketing : or {disfmarker}
User Interface : no .
Marketing : if he has something that works fine and is really {vocalsound} fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .
User Interface : Tha
Project Manager : Not too expensive too .
User Interface : But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller .
Marketing : See {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface : That's the same {disfmarker}
Marketing : That's the problem ,
User Interface : yeah .
Marketing : yeah . I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Ye {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : and so .
Project Manager : Okay . So
Marketing : I mean , that's the point .
Project Manager : let's go to the Industrial Designer .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , so .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Two ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah , participant two um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Working ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah , working design ,
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : so .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : So I think {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I can {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Can you go to the {vocalsound} next one ? I uh {disfmarker} it's not this one .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : It's uh oth the oth {vocalsound} so I {disfmarker}
Marketing : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : It's the working design . Sorry . {vocalsound} Component design .
Project Manager : It's okay {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : So this yeah {disfmarker} so this is the described use {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : What ? Are you inst
Project Manager : Uh I think there's something wrong with your {disfmarker}
User Interface : It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it .
Project Manager : Maybe you you record it somewhere else .
Industrial Designer : I don't think so .
User Interface : Participant one . Participant one .
Project Manager : Interface concept . No .
Marketing : Hmm .
Project Manager : Mm mm .
Industrial Designer : Oh . Maybe I record recorded directly on the {disfmarker} Computer .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Uh . {vocalsound} Nope . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Dunno .
Industrial Designer : Okay , okay . Yes .
Project Manager : It seems that we have a problem with the {disfmarker}
Marketing : I dunno if you remember what you had to say or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I can say it to you without .
Project Manager : Yeah , so {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , maybe we can first come to
Project Manager : No , I think it will be more interesting to start with uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : uh to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides ,
Marketing : I think it's more interesting what he says ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah ,
User Interface : then present it later .
Marketing : okay .
Industrial Designer : exac
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : You will had s some more information in {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah , true .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface : Okay . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : In fact , I don't know ,
Project Manager : So . Okay .
Industrial Designer : I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Okay , never mind .
Industrial Designer : so {disfmarker} It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : of the remote control . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside
User Interface : Okay . Okay .
Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker} so . So I {disfmarker} in fact the the {disfmarker} f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use ,
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : so will {disfmarker} it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and {vocalsound} in which which which kind will be the the different bu button ,
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night ,
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : or , you know , you can see them in the darkness .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation
User Interface : Uh-huh .
Industrial Designer : or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come
User Interface : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker} so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example .
Project Manager : Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , yeah mm .
Project Manager : and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers
Industrial Designer : Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Marketing : Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager : and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : no ?
Industrial Designer : Alrigh In fact , having them both will {disfmarker} if we want to have battery , regular battery and and {vocalsound} the solar energy battery it could be {disfmarker} it'll it will add a little bit of the price ,
Project Manager : So .
Industrial Designer : but it will be an added value also that will be compensated ,
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : so hmm .
Project Manager : And what tha what about the uh materials ?
Industrial Designer : And the materials , it depends for example you {disfmarker} if you have a wooden material it can be more {disfmarker} the plastic material is more common
Project Manager : Impersonal , mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Special for {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : or you know , you can have some {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , and i if you {disfmarker} we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Mm .
Industrial Designer : and it can be interesting .
Project Manager : Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm .
Industrial Designer : And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .
Project Manager : Yeah , we want something easy to use and {disfmarker} so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
Project Manager : And you think that we will be {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros ,
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : so .
Project Manager : So wood .
Industrial Designer : {gap}
Project Manager : And what about the buttons ?
Industrial Designer : I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know {vocalsound} lighted buttons because , you know , it's {disfmarker} I don't know {vocalsound} um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion
Project Manager : No it's fashion , yeah .
Industrial Designer : and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right .
Marketing : What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I think a touch screen {vocalsound} will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .
Marketing : Mm .
Industrial Designer : But {disfmarker} And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : So you got email ?
Project Manager : I dunno . {vocalsound} I think we have only {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh five minutes left .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : Participant four ? Functional requirements ?
Marketing : Uh no , trend watching . {vocalsound} The other one . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : This one ?
Marketing : Yeah . Uh , I think so , just {disfmarker} Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} i i it sounds good technically
User Interface : Mm .
Industrial Designer : Mm .
Marketing : but it's it's not what they want and uh {disfmarker} So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .
Industrial Designer : {gap}
Marketing : Now i if we look at fashion in general um {disfmarker} Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,
Industrial Designer : Ah yes .
Marketing : okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah .
Marketing : 'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important ";yes;4;yes;4;yes;2;yes;4;yes;5;no;0;yes;3
"Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {gap}
Marketing : {gap}
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm So , ready ? {gap}
User Interface : 'Kay
Marketing : No not really Just {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Crap .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Sorry , {vocalsound} I I um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : It's perfect . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Your judgement it's {disfmarker} is biased . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : I'm afraid {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : 'Kay , so whe where is the remote control ?
Project Manager : {vocalsound} So , we are {vocalsound}
User Interface : Where ? {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : It's here . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : So {vocalsound} let's go for our detailed design meeting .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Marketing : Yep .
Project Manager : So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan ,
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} and our Industrial Designer , Baba .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} So we'll have to evaluate the uh {disfmarker} your proposed remote control ,
User Interface : 'Kay .
Project Manager : and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} And in case if we're {disfmarker} we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} So maybe I will let the {disfmarker} our two designers talk about so their {disfmarker}
User Interface : I have slides .
Project Manager : You have s oh , sorry .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Oops .
User Interface : Ah ,
Industrial Designer : Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything .
User Interface : Product prod
Marketing : What slides ?
User Interface : Yep . Okay . Okay . {vocalsound} So , this is our product or prototype . This is made by clay .
Project Manager : Looks strange . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour ,
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : It's {disfmarker} we call it a mushroom design .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah . Uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : So this is a introduction of our product .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but
User Interface : Next a mo
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Okay ,
Project Manager : {vocalsound} {disfmarker} keep on speaking .
User Interface : yeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Oh .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah I'm sure {vocalsound} . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Maybe , I hope so . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's true .
User Interface : Um , and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel .
Project Manager : Chan
User Interface : So it's quite convenient for user to use it .
Project Manager : Yeah , okay , but don't touch {disfmarker} don't destroy your prototype . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah , s {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : okay . Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button . You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Everything's mushroom . So we can call our remote control the mushroom .
Industrial Designer : Yeah {gap} .
User Interface : Yeah , everything's mushroom . Mush Mushroom design , yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh {vocalsound} like lemon shape , you know , centre {vocalsound} is yellow and t d
User Interface : Yeah
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : To integrate , you know {disfmarker} yeah .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : I don't think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I hope nobody will eat it {gap} You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} in
Project Manager : Oh .
User Interface : Yeah
Marketing : Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . I mean there was fruits {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager : Fruits and vegetables .
Industrial Designer : Really ? But {disfmarker} Fruit and vegetable ,
Project Manager : Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable .
Industrial Designer : so mushroom was a kind of you know {gap} uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah .
Marketing : I don't think it is .
Project Manager : It's vegetable .
Industrial Designer : Mushroom ?
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Oh , uh I'm not sure . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : So th it's something eatable .
Industrial Designer : We can {disfmarker} it's a veg a kind of vegetable ,
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : but you know we we integrated them with different colour .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine .
User Interface : Yeah . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable {gap} you know . This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know .
Marketing : No , I mean , yeah {vocalsound} yeah . Inspira inspiration is {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : And inspired colour
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : and {vocalsound} and very sophisticated material , so .
Marketing : True .
Industrial Designer : And so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Next slide .
User Interface : Uh , no this our only two slides . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {gap}
Industrial Designer : So what we w what I can add is that , you know {vocalsound} he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : it is a low level chip , and {disfmarker}
User Interface : So we cut it to see . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : You know , we don't need to k {vocalsound} .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : You know wi {vocalsound} the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i
User Interface : Okay . So where's the battery battery ?
Industrial Designer : The battery it is under {gap} .
Project Manager : In the base .
Industrial Designer : It is in th in {disfmarker} in the base , yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : In the basement . In the basement .
User Interface : Base . Here ?
Project Manager : And where is the solar solar cell ?
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : But we say uh we sa we said solar .
Project Manager : Where is the solar cell ?
Industrial Designer : In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Oh . Do you think it won't be {disfmarker} It won't cris increase the price ?
User Interface : Okay
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {gap} I don't think so ,
Project Manager : Okay , we'll see after .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} but it it's might be okay , so .
Project Manager : We will have first to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I it might be okay . So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ?
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : I mean , we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about {disfmarker} uh
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : we had three keys {disfmarker} {vocalsound} key points to uh for this remote control design ,
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : and first one was uh
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : fancy look and feel .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Uh just let me check .
Industrial Designer : So , four point {disfmarker} three point five , it means it's acceptable .
Marketing : One one being true , and seven being false . Okay .
Industrial Designer : Oops .
Marketing : Ouch . So
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ?
User Interface : Yeah , I think so .
Industrial Designer : I think you have nice colours . {vocalsound} I don't {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing : But is it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : The sha the bowl shape people like .
User Interface : Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour {disfmarker}
Marketing : Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Is it really fancy ?
User Interface : {vocalsound} So it depend on how d do you define fancy .
Marketing : Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : But it's {disfmarker} you have the lemon aspect of this th this {vocalsound} this thing . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Maybe if you change {disfmarker} if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Do Don't do that , please .
Marketing : I dunno where the lemon is , but
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : I mean it's not obvious .
Project Manager : It would be bet more like a lemon ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : If {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Because i
Marketing : I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Less button .
User Interface : Uh so , my mush {disfmarker} .
Industrial Designer : {gap}
Project Manager : Looks like more fruit . Maybe a pineapple ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but you don't have any button now .
User Interface : Mm .
Marketing : Yeah . I dunno .
Project Manager : And you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ?
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : That's uh yeah , is that {disfmarker}
User Interface : Hmm .
Industrial Designer : that's a good idea .
Marketing : Yeah , it's getting {disfmarker}
Project Manager : It looks {vocalsound} more like a pineapple .
Industrial Designer : So that's great . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Sorry .
Industrial Designer : That's great . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : What's the use for that ?
Industrial Designer : I have no idea , so . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Uh , for turn turn the ball . If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : I have no idea {vocalsound} what {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And where is the voice recognition ?
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : Uh . Ah , it's embedded , your microphone .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Th this th th there's two two functions .
Marketing : Yeah , that's {disfmarker} Wait th that's the second point .
User Interface : This is microphone array {disfmarker}
Marketing : First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .
Industrial Designer : If it is fancy or not .
Project Manager : Okay . Is it better like that ?
Marketing : I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Looks {disfmarker} okay ,
Industrial Designer : So we can we can say t
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : let's say it's a pineapple now . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : The colour , is the colour acceptable ?
Marketing : {vocalsound} No , the colour is okay , that's fine .
Industrial Designer : So the shape now .
Marketing : I mean it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager : It looks like a {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Marketing : but I would say there is more {disfmarker} too much red .
Project Manager : now you took it .
Industrial Designer : It's too much red ?
Marketing : Um if
Industrial Designer : In the basement ?
Project Manager : It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Okay .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Right . So , from one to seven ?
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I will give {disfmarker} I will {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm uh {disfmarker} Seven is the ma the maximum ?
Industrial Designer : I'll gi
Marketing : No , seven is false and one is true .
Industrial Designer : I'll give two or three .
Project Manager : Three , I will say three .
Industrial Designer : Three , it's okay . Three , three . Three is fine for me .
Marketing : Three ?
User Interface : 'Kay
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : Isn't it bitter like that {gap} ?
Marketing : Three .
User Interface : Yeah yeah yeah . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Then {vocalsound} uh let me {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : What other {disfmarker}
Marketing : The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .
Industrial Designer : Is it easy to use ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Feasible ? {vocalsound} You said previously that you {disfmarker} there's um microphone inside an
Industrial Designer : Ye uh {disfmarker} Embedded .
User Interface : Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact .
Industrial Designer : It's a micro array , okay .
User Interface : There four microphone .
Project Manager : Oh . Okay ,
User Interface : So they they they they {disfmarker} there's a microphone array .
Project Manager : and you have the {disfmarker} there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ?
User Interface : Yeah , yeah .
Project Manager : And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ?
User Interface : So you can capture voice {disfmarker} yeah , you c
Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : And I think you {disfmarker} you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is {disfmarker} I
Marketing : Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} W Yeah , but {disfmarker}
Project Manager : We have tactile buttons .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : I see , you have microphone array embedded . You have {disfmarker}
Marketing : No , that's good . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : That's good .
Project Manager : Oh , yeah .
Marketing : Yeah , th that's another really good point . Maybe {disfmarker} okay .
Industrial Designer : I think technically it's acceptable , so {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Maybe two ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : So using the same scale , two ?
Project Manager : Two ? I would say two
Industrial Designer : Two , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so .
Project Manager : . You agree ?
User Interface : Yeah , I agree .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : It's better like that , isn't it ?
User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing : Now maybe the most critical one .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Most {disfmarker}
Marketing : {vocalsound} L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ?
Industrial Designer : Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . But it's just speaking .
User Interface : Yeah , it's very easy .
Industrial Designer : You just need the command .
User Interface : You can use this in this way .
Marketing : Yeah but this this turning {disfmarker} can you can you just re explain me the {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : As a principle . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Please .
User Interface : Th this is the base .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : So you can turn to change the channel .
Marketing : Yeah . Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?
User Interface : You just tu turn d d
Industrial Designer : I think maybe if you he
Project Manager : Oh , ok I understand .
Marketing : Like if you want to go from {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : You take take {vocalsound} the remote , so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : If you hear some click {disfmarker}
Project Manager : and you can turn like that to change the channel ? {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah but imagine you y
Project Manager : I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to {disfmarker} if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ?
Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : How can you go directly to twenty , for example ? {vocalsound}
User Interface : No , no , no . I {disfmarker} if y uh if {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : it depend on the the angle you turn the {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah . I agree . I agree .
Industrial Designer : Yeah but y how {disfmarker} you need to know {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Marketing : But I mean if you're fro from two ?
User Interface : I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five .
Industrial Designer : I think something that {disfmarker} Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah , you have a {vocalsound} , like that , and so on .
User Interface : So change . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : And you you can {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Oh yeah .
User Interface : Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the {disfmarker} by three hundred thirteen degree .
Marketing : We're not talking {disfmarker} Yeah .
User Interface : So you got how many degree you you {disfmarker} it {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I think you can if you have a scale , so {disfmarker}
User Interface : No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the the turn ,
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : then the angle you stop is the angle you {disfmarker} is the channel you {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?
User Interface : It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the {disfmarker}
Marketing : So you you count {gap} one degree , two degrees , no .
User Interface : Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it .
Marketing : I don't think so . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , it's a bit difficult .
User Interface : I think so {vocalsound} I think so you can do it . {vocalsound} I think so , you can just change .
Industrial Designer : I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah voc vocal command is okay . But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main {disfmarker}
User Interface : There's uh also a number , you know .
Project Manager : Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's {disfmarker} you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel .
Industrial Designer : Uh , yeah , and y that's {disfmarker} yeah .
Project Manager : But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it .
Marketing : And this would be more for browsing , ah .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah . To see uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : yeah {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Seems to be good .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Good choice , mister David Jordan . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah , I mean you're famous . You {gap} .
Industrial Designer : And but I'd {disfmarker}
User Interface : And also you can , if you i
Project Manager : {gap} yeah , what's what's this cherry ?
User Interface : You ca you can turn this . Or you ca you can you can also turn this .
Industrial Designer : It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe .
User Interface : For this you can tune it's for tune . You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}
User Interface : It's like fine , from coarse to fine .
Marketing : Mm .
User Interface : This is coarse , this is fine .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah yeah . That's
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : So it's coarse to fine design .
Industrial Designer : that's very technologic , so . {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Okay the uh th this looks better . Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah is is {disfmarker} this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel .
Industrial Designer : S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates
User Interface : This is from one channel to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : maybe one of the {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah , th you have the vocal commands .
Industrial Designer : Uh it's k {gap}
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : On off .
Industrial Designer : on off , yeah .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Most of the time you have the {disfmarker} yeah it's a sleeping remote control .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , sleeping .
Marketing : Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah .
Project Manager : That's true . W that why we have the solar ti yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} To compensate {gap} .
Marketing : Solar .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : So
Marketing : So , which number ?
Project Manager : {disfmarker} three .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Do you agree ?
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Three ?
User Interface : Yeah , agree , agree .
Marketing : So reasonably , is four , is one ?
Industrial Designer : Three f three for me , it's o it's okay .
Marketing : So , three .
User Interface : {gap}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Four or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and {disfmarker} no and just take the mean .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : And what's your opinion ?
Industrial Designer : Will you give four ?
Marketing : Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me .
Industrial Designer : Five ? Yeah , so maybe if {disfmarker}
User Interface : Uh w w what do y what uh {disfmarker} you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ?
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : I think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have {disfmarker} you just turn the turn the ball .
Industrial Designer : Yeah but y you know {gap} {disfmarker}
User Interface : There's two kind of balls ,
Marketing : So you have {disfmarker}
User Interface : the smaller the the the {disfmarker} so you can c you can c you can control the scale .
Marketing : {vocalsound} yeah .
User Interface : But in the traditional controller , how do {disfmarker} how can you control the scale ?
Marketing : Uh by pushing zero after after the first one .
Industrial Designer : You just push two button , zero and and one .
User Interface : Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : And that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface : yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Are there some buttons ? Okay .
User Interface : Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one .
Project Manager : It's not what you said previously .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Previously you said that turning this was the fine {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , if you're changing your mind .
Industrial Designer : {gap}
Marketing : Fine to coarse .
Project Manager : Fine to coarse .
User Interface : Yeah , yeah .
Project Manager : And from ten to ten channels here .
User Interface : Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Uh there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc
Marketing : Okay . But this this has to stay on the table , right ?
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : This has to stay on the table .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} In fact on a flat place {disfmarker}
User Interface : I i this is just a base . You can just {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : You can {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Oh {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah , no no , no . You can't put it out .
Industrial Designer : Oh ye yes , that's right .
Marketing : Just {disfmarker} It's {disfmarker}
Project Manager : It's just your turning from the base . You need to have everything in hand . If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : It's impossible . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Oh
Project Manager : You need to put it on and turn . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah . You know tha that's the weak point ,
User Interface : {vocalsound} You use your y
Marketing : because with a traditional one you just have one hand .
Project Manager : Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control .
Industrial Designer : my God .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} So th this is a d next generation controller . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Nobody would take it . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Sure . {vocalsound} Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah .
Project Manager : So nobody w will lost {disfmarker} lose it .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} yeah maybe , maybe may
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : it's the next prototype , maybe we cou
User Interface : {vocalsound} Okay okay , okay .
Project Manager : S maybe we can change from th
Industrial Designer : Four . Maybe four , it's okay .
User Interface : Four . Okay .
Project Manager : Four ? Easy to use , four .
Industrial Designer : I'll put four .
Project Manager : Gonna say four .
Marketing : Four .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , four it's more reasonable .
Marketing : Uh it's even easier to {disfmarker} maybe .
Industrial Designer : You can you can erase with this er yeah .
Marketing : Ok
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : Mm .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so . So it's nine ,
Marketing : So , average ?
Industrial Designer : nine over three .
User Interface : Three ?
Marketing : Three ?
Project Manager : Trois . Three . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , it's {gap} .
User Interface : Trois . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Okay , so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : It need maybe some wo further work , but it's {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , especially on the easy to use
Industrial Designer : Yeah , uh s yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : target .
Industrial Designer : Might {disfmarker} it might be fine .
Project Manager : So , th the project is accepted ?
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , b I think {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager : But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Okay .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} So uh mm mm . Mm .
Industrial Designer : That's the finance .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation . So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : Mm . Okay .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} So we need to calculate the production cost . As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : And if not {disfmarker} if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Oh yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : So , just have a look at the {disfmarker} okay here is the Excel sheet , so
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : so it has the energy source . We have hand dynamo . No , we don't use that .
Marketing : No .
Project Manager : We have battery , right ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah , we have battery .
Project Manager : Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose ,
Industrial Designer : No ,
Project Manager : but we have solar cells .
Industrial Designer : um solar cells , yeah .
Project Manager : Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? Do you think one would be enough , or {disfmarker} such as {vocalsound} as number of branches ?
Industrial Designer : Uh I think in each ball you have three {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Three ?
Industrial Designer : three uh yeah , three , yeah . Three {gap} three solar cells .
Project Manager : So , electronic . Single simple ";yes;4;yes;3;yes;1;yes;3;yes;3;no;0;yes;4
"User Interface : Two .
Project Manager : Hello . Hello .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Good morning .
Marketing : Hello . Ah .
Project Manager : You have to put it exactly on the on the {disfmarker} yeah .
Marketing : Plate ? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : Good morning .
Industrial Designer : Good morning .
Project Manager : I took your mouse .
Industrial Designer : Should I bring my uh pen too ?
Project Manager : Yeah just {disfmarker} yeah , no ,
Industrial Designer : Or {disfmarker}
Project Manager : that's for me , I just have to make some notes . I got my uh mouse .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay .
Marketing : Uh I also forgot my mouse ,
User Interface : Mouse .
Project Manager : {gap} {vocalsound} yeah .
Marketing : but I don't need my mouse , I think .
Industrial Designer : I do .
User Interface : Come on . There we are .
Industrial Designer : My laptop is crashing .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {gap}
Marketing : Damn computers . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Cr
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Help help help .
User Interface : Let's just check one more time . Mm .
Marketing : Can you hear me ? Hello ?
Project Manager : Uh actually my laptop doesn't work ,
Marketing : Test .
Project Manager : {gap} switch it on again .
Marketing : I dunno .
Project Manager : Oh no .
Marketing : Check . Okay . I think it works .
Industrial Designer : Test test . Yes , it's working .
Project Manager : So you all read what we are going to do or not ?
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : We're gonna make a remote control .
Project Manager : Yeah , that's right .
Industrial Designer : I think my laptop is a bit
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : etchy .
Project Manager : I just made a a simple uh presentation . So you {gap} put some things in it .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Okay . How does this work ? I dunno . {gap}
User Interface : One uh {disfmarker} most to the right .
Industrial Designer : Uh p
User Interface : Yes that one .
Project Manager : This one ?
User Interface : Yes .
Marketing : Press F_ eleven .
Project Manager : Ah cool . Okay . So
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : that's my name , {gap} . Uh we're going to make uh a remote control , you already know that . Just have a look , are we going to {disfmarker} uh this agenda of our meeting . You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . So um the {gap} thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do , you also read what this the things {disfmarker} or , not yet ,
User Interface : Yes .
Project Manager : okay . So um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly {gap} that's what we're going to design . Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important . We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting . The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it {disfmarker} that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . And we have to look what uh the market is doing for {disfmarker} what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . {vocalsound} Okay so {disfmarker} uh no , this is a {disfmarker} these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one . And you already saw {disfmarker} you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map .
Marketing : Folder ,
Project Manager : Folder , okay .
Marketing : yes .
Project Manager : So no okay {gap} have a look at that one . Okay . So uh what we're going to do first is um so you can read . {vocalsound} You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard

Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : I don't know , what time did we start this meeting , I'm not sure .
User Interface : Uh I think it was uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Half past .
Marketing : Half past ten .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : Brilliant .
Project Manager : Okay , perfect .
Industrial Designer : Nice , eh ? {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yep .
Project Manager : Yeah , thank you . Now we just have to save everything , so . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Oh
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : this is definitely the best one .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Uh .
Project Manager : Okay , so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros . Okay ,
Industrial Designer : Excuse me .
Project Manager : that's {gap} . And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe . The production cost are about half the price of selling price ,
User Interface : Piece of cake .
Project Manager : sorry .
User Interface : Uh easy .
Project Manager : So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . Uh so we're gonna have {gap} a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the {gap} and everything , so just have a look how it {disfmarker} we think about remote controls .
Marketing : Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a {vocalsound} a universal remote control ?
Project Manager : Oh yeah , that's a good question .
Marketing : Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart .
Project Manager : I think it's {disfmarker} I'm not I'm not sure ,
Marketing : So I {disfmarker}
Project Manager : it's not mm {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , it probably would be universal .
User Interface : Universal .
Marketing : Because {disfmarker} {gap}
User Interface : And only television ? Or more devices ?
Project Manager : I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , so {disfmarker} not sure , but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Hmm , maybe , I don't know .
Marketing : Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros
Project Manager : Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . Okay , perfect .
User Interface : Ah okay .
Marketing : Yeah , I think .
Industrial Designer : And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player
Project Manager : Yeah , everything
Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : just {disfmarker} so a lot of buttons {vocalsound} on the remote control .
Industrial Designer : okay . {vocalsound} Yeah , probably .
User Interface : Not just a T_V_ .
Project Manager : No , just everything .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : {gap} . so yeah ,
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not {disfmarker} nothing very special , but um {disfmarker}
User Interface : Well we can try to make it special .
Project Manager : yeah , that's right .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user {vocalsound}
User Interface : Well {disfmarker}
Marketing : Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , {gap} {disfmarker} we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter . {vocalsound} Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons . Um I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh {vocalsound} use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality .
Project Manager : Hmm yeah .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : That's right . Should be a good point .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : Nothing {gap} N
Industrial Designer : And how big should it be ?
Marketing : No . Yeah .
User Interface : {gap} It shouldn't be too big ,
Marketing : I dunno um {disfmarker}
User Interface : but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think .
Project Manager : Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it .
User Interface : Yeah . Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface : Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer ,
Marketing : Yes
User Interface : maybe more trendy .
Project Manager : But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open .
User Interface : Fold open ,
Project Manager : Okay ,
User Interface : where you can see uh more options . I think {disfmarker}
Project Manager : yeah , that's cool . Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah
Marketing : Ah
Industrial Designer : n
Marketing : that's that's {disfmarker}
Project Manager : if you just {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often .
Marketing : Ah right right .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , or you c
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control .
Marketing : Oh that's good , yeah .
User Interface : Yeah b I wanted {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Uh maybe be uh it's it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager : There are buttons on it .
User Interface : No you can make an uh manual in it .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small .
Project Manager : Okay . But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .
User Interface : But that's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Uh like a a to have {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , but
User Interface : Yeah , I think it's much uh {disfmarker} too expensive .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , maybe it would .
Marketing : Yeah but it's not reachable I think , touch screen .
Project Manager : {gap}
Marketing : And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken .
Project Manager : Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile .
User Interface : Yeah , too fragile .
Marketing : Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : No . You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Kid-proof .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah {gap} .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} And uh how about the batteries ?
Marketing : Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Uh should you put it in a recharger or a {disfmarker} just {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Oh maybe that's a good idea ,
Marketing : Ma maybe a home station .
Project Manager : just to put it on your television and just s recharge ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : you never have to use any batteries .
Industrial Designer : Mm yeah .
User Interface : Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think .
Project Manager : Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ?
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I dunno .
User Interface : Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ?
Project Manager : I dunno .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive ,
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Ah yeah .
Industrial Designer : but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing .
Marketing : {gap}
User Interface : Maybe have {gap} uh {disfmarker}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably {disfmarker} it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive .
User Interface : Yeah , 'cause well {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are {disfmarker} uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is ,
Project Manager : Yeah , that's right , yeah .
Marketing : and now you can put it always at the same place .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Maybe it's {disfmarker} Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive .
User Interface : Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately .
Marketing : Yeah . You can {disfmarker} yeah , you can buy it with it .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : Rechargeable .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : or you can change your batteries ,
Marketing : Oh yeah .
Industrial Designer : so .
Project Manager : The option , just the option , that's cool .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Uh I I set something on paper already , {gap} size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : uh it has to lay good in the hand ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : you you have to uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Has it be {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control
Marketing : Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know
Project Manager : or {disfmarker}
User Interface : Well I think we have to look at that ,
Marketing : if we {disfmarker}
User Interface : 'cause well you can do {gap} the standard way , but then you won't {disfmarker}
Marketing : You can make it very special , to create our own um looks ,
Project Manager : Yeah
Marketing : but it's very hard to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .
User Interface : Well you can um have uh {vocalsound} the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see .
Marketing : Nah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : so you can do something unique with that .
Industrial Designer : And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you {vocalsound} can still uh do the th the functions .
Marketing : Yeah yeah , what Paul already said .
Project Manager : Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Uh on on top are the the basic options on top ,
Industrial Designer : But n {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah , yeah .
Industrial Designer : yeah , but uh i {vocalsound} basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so ,
Marketing : and if you fold it open {disfmarker}
Project Manager : But maybe it's
User Interface : Yeah {gap} .
Marketing : {gap}
User Interface : That's what I meant .
Industrial Designer : so .
Project Manager : maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh {disfmarker} what's it's called ?
Marketing : Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an {disfmarker} uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control .
Project Manager : {gap} Maybe it's hard t
User Interface : Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : No , that's right . So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control {gap} .
User Interface : Okay , but yeah .
Project Manager : Just think about it .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : There's some more things . We have uh another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again . So you know what you have to {disfmarker} what you have to do ?
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound} No , what you want to do with it .
Project Manager : Yeah , I think this {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . Also from a user , but all these things together .
Marketing : Okay . Yeah , it's also about strength and uh for everything uh .
Project Manager : Yeah , everything .
User Interface : Yeah , I also wrote down some stuff
Project Manager : Yeah ,
User Interface : that you want on a {disfmarker}
Project Manager : no maybe not not uh {gap} , that's not a f that's something for for for {disfmarker} yeah .
User Interface : Technical fun fu
Project Manager : That's not for you . Just if {disfmarker}
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have .
User Interface : What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control .
Project Manager : Yeah , it's alright .
User Interface : I already wrote some down , some ideas .
Marketing : Yep .
Project Manager : Yeah , just {disfmarker} is that okay ?
User Interface : Yep .
Marketing : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : There's already a document in the folder about it .
Marketing : Yeah , me too .
Project Manager : So see you in thirty minutes .
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : Okay , well done .

Marketing : Oh . {vocalsound} Sorry .
User Interface : Uh let's see . Which one was mine ?
Project Manager : So let's have a look , we have forty minutes , so it's it's more than enough . {gap} Okay , perfect . So we have {disfmarker} Oh no , what's that ? So so we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting , and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure , that we are ,
User Interface : Good .
Project Manager : that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like {disfmarker} look like . Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting , so I showed uh show them to you . Oh , sorry about that , I just escape this one . How do I escape this ? How do I I escape this s uh presentation ?
Industrial Designer : What ?
User Interface : Uh left .
Industrial Designer : Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Ah okay .
User Interface : So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Just {disfmarker} Yeah .
Project Manager : And show , sorry . Okay , so let's have a look s at this one . Okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um {disfmarker} Should be a univ uh universal remote control {disfmarker} No , that's {disfmarker} I uh s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . So have you changed that part ?
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : Okay . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um so {disfmarker} yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . It's it's still the same . Um {disfmarker} All these points uh we have to look at . You all know them . But uh there's another point . The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . So they're old and not younger people . So we have to look at that as well . 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno .
User Interface : Yeah , okay .
Project Manager : Uh so {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : Which one first ?
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : Oh it doesn't matter , just start with the {disfmarker}
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : Mm . Uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : Functional requirements , yeah
Marketing : Okay . Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . Wait . Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site . Uh I think you've uh read it too . Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site .
Project Manager : I I didn't read i read it , so it's not for me ,
Marketing : You didn't read it ?
Project Manager : I didn't get it uh anyway .
User Interface : No , I didn don't thing we got it .
Project Manager : It's only for you .
Marketing : Oh okay , I I was the only one who get it .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yes .
Marketing : Okay it was uh uh uh um um {vocalsound} a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . I think this fits uh at the {vocalsound} uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . Well okay , that's uh normal . I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . But that's one of our requirements .
Project Manager : The last point is quite an interesting {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .
Project Manager : So
Marketing : Um Martijn alr already said it .
Project Manager : if we {disfmarker} Yeah .
Marketing : And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but {disfmarker} I don't think it's uh
Project Manager : Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top ,
Marketing : reachable .
Project Manager : then you're you're {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : That that's a good one . Um uh page two . Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you {vocalsound} clap your hands it will beep or something . Uh you must find it uh quickly .
User Interface : Uh . Maybe just a button on the home station . So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station .
Marketing : Okay , yeah . Yeah , we can uh combine that . Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . It's only uh th thirty four of the {vocalsound} thirty four percent . But it's uh a tough one . Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think . Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . I don't {disfmarker} We we haven't {disfmarker} Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . Okay , last page .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . We didn't uh think about that already . And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control . We already thought about that . Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . And but they're more critical . And older people uh want to spend uh more money . {vocalsound} But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they're in their old uh thinking way . And they want to keep the old uh things the old things . {gap}
Project Manager : So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus .
Marketing : But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ?
Project Manager : People . So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control ,
Marketing : I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : because {disfmarker} Yeah .
Marketing : because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros .
Project Manager : It's too {disfmarker} Okay .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Um then {disfmarker} I have my personal uh preference . Okay , that's {vocalsound} not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . I had a question about . But it's already out of the question , this . Um my point is , well , I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . But it's the exercise .
Project Manager : Because it's too expensive . Yeah , probably .
Marketing : Yeah , only only for television uh {disfmarker} On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special .
User Interface : Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it .
Marketing : Okay , I told about the home station . Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . And I I found a motto . And we put the fashion in electronics . And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . We we have to make a {vocalsound} a new product . We have to be um {disfmarker} Yeah . One of a kind , I think .
Project Manager : So it has to look uh uh uh unique ,
User Interface : Unique .
Marketing : {vocalsound} The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style .
Project Manager : but {disfmarker} Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , I reckon {disfmarker}
Project Manager : But old people are not looking for that .
User Interface : Uh I think mm {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Not really .
User Interface : Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah . I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah ,
Project Manager : Okay . Yeah .
Marketing : to k to keep it simple when you {disfmarker}
User Interface : But uh we also have to stand out ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Sorry I thought about it , yes .
User Interface : 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . So make it just a different colour or different shape ,
Project Manager : Yeah . Okay .
User Interface : so {disfmarker}
Marketing : Okay , this was uh my presentation .
Project Manager : Thanks .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Marketing : I don't {disfmarker}
Project Manager : So
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Paul , you can do the next one if you want .
Marketing : You can ask some questions or something .
User Interface : Okay . Yeah well {disfmarker} Uh .
Project Manager : It's on the on the uh net net uh thing ,
User Interface : There it is .
Project Manager : isn't it ?
User Interface : Okay . Technical functions design . Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . Isn't {disfmarker} that isn't true anymore . But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used .
Project Manager : So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , I have it on the next page .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : to find out . But there is already in a one done . Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to {gap} . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off . And I found an uh {disfmarker} Could I think of favourites ? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . So you might as well remember the number . Or not ?
Project Manager : Maybe i maybe it's too complicated ,
User Interface : No y
Project Manager : but not sure {gap} .
User Interface : Well
Project Manager : It's a good idea , but {disfmarker}
User Interface : it's {disfmarker} It was just a thought . So I'm , I u {disfmarker} I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay . But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ?
User Interface : Well uh
Project Manager : Uh {gap} {disfmarker}
User Interface : what I was reading on the page . Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . So switch to channel six .
Industrial Designer : Yeah ?
User Interface : So uh button six says says six . And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . Just numbers . That can be in the in the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah okay . But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel .
User Interface : Well if you said a favourite {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but isn't it hard to remember ? Like favourite one and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Uh mayb for me it's {disfmarker}
User Interface : Well i
Project Manager : If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never .
User Interface : Never ? Oh .
Industrial Designer : No , neither do I .
Project Manager : So {disfmarker}
User Interface : Oh are you ?
Project Manager : And {disfmarker}
User Interface : Okay now , m maybe not .
Project Manager : If I don't do it , maybe old people {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface : No , maybe elderly people uh . Right .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I dunno .
User Interface : They don't like new features . So maybe not .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : Um well play , pause . I dunno if that's usable
Project Manager : It's not , it's still not {disfmarker} It's not anymore n uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : when {disfmarker} Not anymore for T_V_ .
Project Manager : {gap}
User Interface : Right , on off . {vocalsound} I dunno , miss {disfmarker} Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for T_V_ .
Marketing : Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Just on the front as well . No , that's the only th the only thing you need .
User Interface : Is {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Uh uh the p uh next and previous . Previous I know , but next channel ?
User Interface : Just the channel um uh {disfmarker} What I mean is uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I don't thi
Marketing : Forward .
Industrial Designer : Li like a web browser ,
User Interface : Six seven eight or five .
Industrial Designer : so {disfmarker} Oh , okay .
Project Manager : Just very simple .
Industrial Designer : But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before . Like a web browser back button .
User Interface : Um I dunno .
Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} Yeah ,
User Interface : I don't have {disfmarker} Uh I did {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I know what it is , but I think it's all too difficult for old people . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah ,
Marketing : No . Uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : I don't think you use that . Y only when you want to go to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay .
User Interface : Yeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time .
Project Manager : And how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : Normally you can press one , zero or {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . So you have that uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : A ten plus or {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , the ten plus button . Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : To just keep it simple and standard uh features .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to uh {disfmarker} Because you h have to be fast enough . Maybe the elderly people {disfmarker}
User Interface : Uh yeah mayb
Marketing : It gets some seconds .
User Interface : But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes .
Industrial Designer : Oh okay . Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah , it's it's no it's not a {disfmarker}
User Interface : So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but that's th mm {disfmarker}
Marketing : It's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that {disfmarker} And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager : But do we still need a two level remote control ? Because if we only have that l only f
Marketing : It's only for television now .
User Interface : So I I don't think so .
Project Manager : No .
User Interface : Uh I just thought of another one .
Marketing : No .
User Interface : Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : So you also need a menu button . And then uh navigation uh {disfmarker} But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : so you have
Industrial Designer : I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button .
User Interface : four arrows .
Industrial Designer : Because you n almost never use menu button .
User Interface : Yeah , okay ,
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker}
User Interface : but um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . You'll also have to use a mute button to to {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , a mute button . Yes .
Project Manager : Maybe , not {disfmarker}
User Interface : Don't think so .
Project Manager : I don't know where where you have to put it .
User Interface : Yeah well ,
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : that's that's {disfmarker} I think that's the layers that produce . Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use .
Project Manager : Okay . Yeah . Yeah . That's right .
User Interface : And later we can d uh do the design .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : Okay , uh now my personal preferences . Uh using the standards , basic {disfmarker} Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls .
Project Manager : Yeah . Does it have to be {disfmarker} Uh it has to be uh with different colours
User Interface : Um {disfmarker} I dunno . Different colours um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : or {disfmarker}
Marketing : Maybe we can give it out in different colours . You can choose blue or yellow
Project Manager : It's like a iMac or something .
Marketing : or {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Just to make it {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : Yeah . Well why not ? Or {disfmarker} Yeah .
Marketing : That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion .
Project Manager : But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing . It's only twenty five Euros . It looks very cheap if you make it {disfmarker}
User Interface : Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones .
Project Manager : Oh , you just {disfmarker} I dunno what happened .
User Interface : Oh .
Marketing : {gap}
User Interface : Who ?
Project Manager : Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . Just {disfmarker}
User Interface : They they're uh designed very well .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : But uh well , I think that's a good example .
Project Manager : Okay , {gap}
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it .
User Interface : Okay , sorry .
Project Manager : Is it fin Are you finished ?
User Interface : Well uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Yeah , I I'm finished . I think we discussed everything .
Industrial Designer : Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . Um {disfmarker} Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh {disfmarker} Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh {disfmarker} And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it . And that's uh another diode , I believe .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : Because infrared is not visible . So that's er uh do two different things
Project Manager : So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?
Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker} Yeah . I I think so . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Uh j Is {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I I'm not sure if it's the same thing .
Project Manager : Yeah , it's {disfmarker} I think it's usable .
User Interface : Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ?
Marketing : Yeah , that's active .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : Or just a green one ,
User Interface : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : because it's {disfmarker} If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green .
User Interface : Yeah . Maybe uh {disfmarker}
Marketing : I I think it's in the case that it's active . It's not uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , that's right .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , when you press it .
Project Manager : But if you {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker}
Marketing : I it's it's just uh the the {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Red's l shows up like something's wrong ,
Industrial Designer : Two ?
Project Manager : and green is like it's okay , you press the button .
Marketing : Mm .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I dunno .
User Interface : Maybe depends on uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red .
Project Manager : Yeah , I know .
User Interface : Yes .
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay , we make it red .
User Interface : But maybe {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : So
User Interface : Well
Industrial Designer : I know .
User Interface : we don't have to make it red . Maybe integrate it in the design as well .
Project Manager : You have to {disfmarker} The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . Uh that's cool . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I I think uh the batteries will be uh {vocalsound} a little {disfmarker}
User Interface : Uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Oh ,
Marketing : {vocalsound} Empty .
User Interface : maybe it's it is would an e No . Just uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : No , we have a recharger in it , so {disfmarker}
User Interface : Oh .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay .
Project Manager : If we can still make that then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Uh maybe .
User Interface : Yeah , but it doesn't have to be red .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : It's just to indicate something's on .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . That it's working . That it's not not the batteries are low .
Project Manager : But it's cool if it was green .
User Interface : Yeah . It's it's not very important ,
Project Manager : Green or red or whatever , it is cool . {vocalsound}
User Interface : so yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I know . Just to indicate it's working .
User Interface : So mm {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the {disfmarker} Otherwise it won't work .
User Interface : So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : No . I I uh {disfmarker} The chip um uh is producing the pattern . So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to {disfmarker}
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : An automatically search function for each television , or something .
Industrial Designer : That are working . Yeah , or {disfmarker} I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . It wasn't explained there .
User Interface : Well , I I use a universal uh remote control ,
Marketing : Uh I kno
User Interface : and {gap} list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . And you have to put in a number , so it works on your T_V_ .
Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Okay .
Marketing : Oh , I have a modern one .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , and the LED began to blink blink blink . And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . And then you know , oh it it's the right one . And you can stop it ,
Industrial Designer : Ah okay .
Marketing : and then it's okay . So you don't have to search for your television or your code .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Marketing : It uh search uh the pattern for itself .
User Interface : Okay ,
Industrial Designer : Okay , yeah .
User Interface : so we use that .
Industrial Designer : So it uh {disfmarker} We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . Because you have to {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yes .
User Interface : Yep .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : I just say {disfmarker} Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking {disfmarker} There's just a short {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Uh okay . Well uh y you have this chip .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time .
Marketing : Changing the signal .
Industrial Designer : And um {disfmarker} What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so {disfmarker} And then he saves that setting
Project Manager : Okay . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : and then um it's working .
Marketing : Yeah , that's the right uh option .
Industrial Designer : Okay . Well uh the components .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't {disfmarker} I w I was a little short on time . Um but I think I understand it . Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Um that's connecting to all the components .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Because it has to be fed with energy . Okay . Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed . Um that's connecting to a chip . So the chip knows what button you pressed . And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . I didn didn't put the description by this one . Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light .
Project Manager : Okay . So that's the LED , L_E_D_ .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , and this is a LED too .
Marketing : {gap}
Industrial Designer : But this one is producing infrared light
Project Manager : Yeah , okay .
Industrial Designer : that's invisible . And this one is producing normal light .
Project Manager : So we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one . To flash up your {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Yeah {disfmarker}
Marketing : Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah . Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can {disfmarker} Basically if the battery is low , it won't work .
Marketing : Yeah . Yeah , and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . So you see green if you push that button .
Industrial Designer : Huh , that's a good idea .
Marketing : Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then .
Project Manager : Yeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal .
User Interface : No , y Yeah .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : And it's {disfmarker} you also know which button you p
Marketing : But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs .
Project Manager : Yeah , that's right . But it {disfmarker}
Marketing : Everywhere in the r
Project Manager : But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? You got still one LED .
User Interface : No I don't think so , but {disfmarker} Yeah , i it it will look different , and I think we need to find something else .
Project Manager : That looks different , yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
User Interface : 'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is {disfmarker}
Marketing : Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ?
User Interface : Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even .
Marketing : Yeah , okay .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but mm like when you push it
User Interface : {gap} Yeah , then then won't {disfmarker} Then you won't see it .
Industrial Designer : n n Yeah . You have your finger over the button . So you can see {disfmarker}
Marketing : It must be around it then .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Or or m maybe on top of the {disfmarker} A green light is flashing
Marketing : Yeah , then {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : or {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah . Not not not not here , but here .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . There . Yeah .
Marketing : Maybe uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : The same as a telephone , or a mo";yes;4;yes;4;yes;2;yes;4;yes;3;no;0;yes;3
"User Interface : It's {disfmarker}
Marketing : Bonjour .
User Interface : It won't wake up . Yeah . I was a bit early . Like {disfmarker} What ?
Marketing : Why ?
User Interface : No , I just came in . Uh normally I was one of them .
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : Come on .
Project Manager : Hello .
Marketing : Check check check check .
Project Manager : Oop .
User Interface : Why won't it wake up ? Is it on ?
Marketing : The power light doesn't work . You turned it off .
User Interface : But how ? Ah , there it is .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Uh .
Industrial Designer : I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . So I'll discuss them with you .
Project Manager : Okay , we're just going to the {gap} later .
Marketing : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , I received an email as well .
Project Manager : So we're going to talk about the conceptual model .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh .
Project Manager : {gap}
Marketing : Hmm .
User Interface : Which one was mine ?
Project Manager : So that's me .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Uh okay . So {disfmarker} Uh okay . Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute . {gap} What's it called , I dunno . Whatever .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : The minutes .
Project Manager : Okay , so we just talked about uh {disfmarker} Oh you want me to show that there or {disfmarker}
User Interface : No ,
Industrial Designer : Mm no .
Marketing : Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Okay ,
User Interface : just tell us .
Project Manager : we just talked about it looks . Has to look nice . Usability is very important . People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um {disfmarker} It has to be very basic , not too many buttons . Light switches on if you use a button . Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility . And it has to be easy to learn . That were the things I uh make minutes of . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button . That are the functions . That right ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Yes .
Project Manager : So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation of your {disfmarker}
Marketing : Shall I start ?
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : {gap} {vocalsound} No . Okay well {disfmarker} I received an email {disfmarker} Okay . I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it . Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . So it's very important for us to create something new . So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . Uh it came out of the research . It uh is twice important as the following . {vocalsound} The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . And then uh that uh {disfmarker} This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition .
User Interface : Hmm .
Marketing : But um {vocalsound} this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative .
Project Manager : But we already have the flashing flashing light on the {disfmarker}
Marketing : {vocalsound} Uh maybe maybe something new .
User Interface : Yeah , more .
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
Marketing : We have to discuss about it s uh {disfmarker} Okay , uh {gap}
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Well , I'll I'll get back on it .
Marketing : features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . And that's very hard I think . Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . But uh that was an overall uh point . We already discussed that . Um I've got one picture . Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : So I took uh that part of the webpage . And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari {vocalsound} uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes .
Project Manager : Hmm .
Marketing : But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy .
User Interface : Spongy .
Marketing : But spongy , what what does spongy says ?
Industrial Designer : Spongy .
User Interface : Spongy , like sponge .
Marketing : Spongy . Okay . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : So rubber , kind of .
User Interface : Uh soft materials .
Project Manager : But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . So it has to be {vocalsound} flexible .
User Interface : Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means y Yeah .
Industrial Designer : It's like a sponge .
User Interface : Soft , sponge .
Marketing : So it's also a stress-ball .
Project Manager : That's a good {disfmarker} That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , somewhat like {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah .
Project Manager : Is it a bit like like the the the the {gap} remote control ?
User Interface : How are you gonna make it ?
Project Manager : R_ soft .
Industrial Designer : Yeah ,
Marketing : Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : Okay ?
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : And uh some basic uh colour fronts . {vocalsound} Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . {vocalsound} Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget .
User Interface : Yeah , I'll get back on that .
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
Marketing : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} It's very uh difficult to to to do it .
Marketing : Intro
Project Manager : Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : Well ,
Marketing : Yeah , that's the problem . That's the main problem .
User Interface : I got f also an email from the the technology department .
Marketing : So {disfmarker} Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .
User Interface : They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech . So they recommended using it .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Well {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : I'll check what they exact mean .
Marketing : Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then .
User Interface : So uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap
User Interface : Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : and it's easy to implement .
User Interface : th that's the only problem . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so {disfmarker} Um but uh
Marketing : {gap}
User Interface : if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well .
Marketing : Oh . It's mass production . So you can say , you can {gap} {disfmarker}
User Interface : Since you have to uh configure speech thing .
Project Manager : But that's definitely more expensive than {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah , that's that's something I dunno .
Marketing : Yeah . But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be {gap} .
Project Manager : Yeah , but a telephone {gap} {disfmarker} Okay , yeah . But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros .
User Interface : Yeah , so uh we gotta de
Project Manager : So uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : We have to decide on that .
Marketing : Yeah . Okay . That was this ?
User Interface : Mm uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Oh I got an email uh {disfmarker} And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . And {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . And this is more expensive than all the other chips . So
User Interface : L_D_C_ doesn't require {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : it's m the most expensive . Yeah , it says in the email . The display requires an advanced chip .
User Interface : Okay . And speech recognition ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah , probably too .
User Interface : Advanced {gap} . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but {disfmarker}
User Interface : I'll I'll give you my design .
Industrial Designer : Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . If we're doing uh if we're doing a display .
User Interface : Yeah okay . So we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well we can {disfmarker} I had uh to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um {disfmarker} This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones .
Project Manager : Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic .
User Interface : More modern . Y yes . Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out {disfmarker} both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . And then changeable fonts , so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
User Interface : It's the most important part , I think . But {disfmarker} And the home base is something like that , something simple . Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons .
Project Manager : Yeah , maybe the teletext tel
User Interface : Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable ,
Project Manager : No .
User Interface : but it's {disfmarker}
Marketing : No , I don't uh {disfmarker} I don't like it .
User Interface : Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
User Interface : and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten . {vocalsound} And I think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : But it {disfmarker} That's on on the display .
User Interface : No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : So the focus is on these two parts .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : So you don't see all the buttons you else need .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it .
User Interface : Uh well um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : So you can't use your thumb for it .
User Interface : This is how it is now . Um {disfmarker} Here uh {disfmarker} Well we have volume .
Project Manager : Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : I think it is on uh on the bottom too .
Project Manager : down there . But it's not not the best best .
User Interface : Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls . I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay .
Project Manager : Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too .
Project Manager : Yeah , why not .
User Interface : For volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more .
Industrial Designer : Scroll .
User Interface : By just putting the volume on the side .
Project Manager : And the channels as well .
User Interface : And and just channel buttons here .
Project Manager : Oh yeah .
User Interface : But I think uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , or uh maybe uh {disfmarker} The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control .
User Interface : Well . Yeah , well it's {disfmarker} Basically it's it's here .
Industrial Designer : Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom .
Project Manager : Yeah , that's better .
User Interface : They're on top ?
Project Manager : Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom .
Industrial Designer : Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons .
User Interface : You mean uh these to the low ?
Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Yeah . Except from the on-off button .
User Interface : Oh okay . Well , yeah .
Industrial Designer : But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . So maybe we can put that on the bottom .
User Interface : Mm {disfmarker} Maybe . I dunno , but yeah we'll {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time .
User Interface : Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be should be easy to {gap} . I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .
Industrial Designer : Yeah okay .
User Interface : And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh {vocalsound} you don't see 'em very good .
Industrial Designer : That's that's good , but {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound} I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there .
Industrial Designer : Yeah okay .
User Interface : But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : So we can uh switch these to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
User Interface : I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half .
Industrial Designer : No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top .
User Interface : Okay . Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : But uh we we can switch those two ,
User Interface : Those two , yeah .
Industrial Designer : yeah .
User Interface : And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh {disfmarker} Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right . {gap}
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we {disfmarker} I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open .
Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah , that's cool .
User Interface : To use {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : No .
User Interface : So that's something we have to decide on .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , we have to keep it simple .
Project Manager : We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look .
User Interface : Yeah . What we're gonna do . Okay .
Industrial Designer : Okay , the component design . I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not {disfmarker} Nothing square-like .
Project Manager : Okay , so {disfmarker} Hmm , okay . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . And it is well curved {gap} square .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah .
Marketing : Square . Like .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think .
User Interface : Okay . So not {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing .
User Interface : Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of
Project Manager : Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the {vocalsound} remote control .
Industrial Designer : looking , I think .
Marketing : Mm .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : So the colours also .
User Interface : Mm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager : So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow .
User Interface : Black yellow control . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public .
User Interface : Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But {disfmarker}
Project Manager : We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .
Industrial Designer : No , okay . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , okay .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think .
User Interface : Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , it's cool . Yep .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue
Project Manager : And still trans
User Interface : Yes .
Project Manager : Still still transparent .
User Interface : So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker}
Marketing : Oh yeah .
User Interface : Yeah . But with all with logo on it .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Well this is a remote control , a very old one . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Then the components . The case has just a {disfmarker} Here's black .
Project Manager : Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . Uh I'm not sure .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I dunno .
User Interface : {gap} Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Maybe . But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , huh ?
User Interface : Well one of the options .
Industrial Designer : S
User Interface : You can {disfmarker} Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : So you can just replace them I think . That was the idea ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah , we could do that .
User Interface : or just uh release one .
Project Manager : Yeah . Just give five with them , just in a box . {vocalsound} Five different {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , uh {disfmarker} Or just uh sell different ones .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent .
Project Manager : Yeah . Cool .
Industrial Designer : So you can still th look through it .
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft .
User Interface : Yeah ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : I uh I dunno .
Project Manager : It it could be like a Nokia , like {gap} plastic .
User Interface : A more {disfmarker} Yeah , just uh {disfmarker}
Marketing : {vocalsound} Uh uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : That's better prob
Industrial Designer : With the hard hard buttons .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : I think uh rubber really has an odd look .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Marketing : Yeah . The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the {vocalsound} uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . Uh it's n doesn't {disfmarker} Is {vocalsound} uh a button uh um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How do you say it ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah , it's it's all on one level .
Marketing : It it didn't it i it don't come out of the {vocalsound} on the background .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , on one level .
Marketing : It is in uh the c a remote control uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I know what you mean . So we have to keep it on the one level . Like th the top it's {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah ,
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : like mobile phones . Like uh the iPod .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : Uh just {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay .
Project Manager : Yeah , that's cool .
Industrial Designer : Okay , it's chos So that should be hard plastic . Then the buttons ?
User Interface : {vocalsound} I dunno what uh kind of material it is .
Industrial Designer : I think . Or maybe {disfmarker}
User Interface : But {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . Just only the basic uh
User Interface : Oops .
Project Manager : basic remote control from normal plastic ,
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : and
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : the rounds of it from softer s
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Then the L_E_D_ . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : I dunno .
Industrial Designer : The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . And back light L_E_D_s .
Project Manager : Y
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Cool .
Industrial Designer : But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So if you put {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Y i if you {disfmarker} The numbers could be can be {disfmarker}
User Interface : Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , that's right .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : Or it runs the whole {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : They can choose .
User Interface : Yeah , you can halfs transparent ,
Industrial Designer : Or no
User Interface : or just that it's comes out a bit .
Industrial Designer : Yeah okay . Good . And in green colour , the back lights
User Interface : Different , I think , also .
Industrial Designer : or {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Blue . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Yeah ?
User Interface : Blue or red .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Whatever you want it , I think .
Marketing : {gap} Yeah .
User Interface : Uh depends on the colour of the {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it .
Marketing : Uh i {gap} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : You have to choose {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , that's true . But {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : No , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Is it {disfmarker} Okay .
Marketing : Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : I I know {disfmarker} I dunno . Is {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Marketing : but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ?
User Interface : Yeah , it can .
Project Manager : Yeah , okay .
User Interface : 'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well .
Marketing : You {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive .
Project Manager : Maybe put some different ones in it . Doesn't matter . It's just {disfmarker} No , just some LED .
User Interface : I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone .
Industrial Designer : I think it's {disfmarker}
User Interface : And I can change the colour of it .
Project Manager : Okay , cool . Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I dunno . Maybe it's too expensive , but it {disfmarker} I th I don't think so .
User Interface : Well , we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . So {disfmarker}
Marketing : Hmm .
Industrial Designer : Then uh some more technical things .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : I don't know what it is , but it should be there {vocalsound} I think .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things .
Project Manager : Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : W {vocalsound} So we d we just need this and {vocalsound} this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls .
User Interface : I'm sure we can fit in .
Industrial Designer : So I guess we j we just need that .
Marketing : {gap}
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : I don't know what they do or {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah okay .
Marketing : Okay yeah ,
User Interface : We just {disfmarker}
Marketing : you can you can change {disfmarker} Yeah . No .
Industrial Designer : Nah , but they just said we need it .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in .
Project Manager : Yeah , a recharger maybe .
User Interface : Yeah , we have to make sure to uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah okay .
Project Manager : We still want to have a recharger , don't we ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah but {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Is that still the {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yes . Yes .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an {disfmarker} How do you call it ? Accu .
Project Manager : A recha Oh no . Uh {disfmarker} Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah .
User Interface : Re recharger . Base station .
Industrial Designer : Y uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries .
User Interface : Yeah , batteries . Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best .
Industrial Designer : Okay . Not a separate {disfmarker}
Project Manager : No , just rechargeable batteries .
Industrial Designer : Okay . And uh a chip , that's this one .
Project Manager : {gap}
Industrial Designer : Then uh I received some possibilities . Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh {disfmarker} Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda .
Marketing : Ah cool . Okay .
Project Manager : But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch .
User Interface : So if you hold it , it gets powered .
Industrial Designer : If you hold it . Yeah , I don't think it will work , and {disfmarker} Or we can also use solar cells . But you mostly use it indoors ,
Project Manager : It's dark in the room . No .
User Interface : {gap}
Project Manager : It's just batteries ,
Industrial Designer : so {disfmarker}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : that's cheaper {gap} .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth .
Marketing : Okay .
Industrial Designer : So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons .
User Interface : Mm . So
Industrial Designer : So we can't use the flat buttons .
User Interface : we need uh two D_ .
Project Manager : Yeah . Definitely .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I think . Um these kinda materials can be used .
Project Manager : But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I think so too .
Project Manager : The scroll wheels , that's cool . That's for the volume .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , scroll wheels um {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's good . We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : But I think just the volume is enough .
User Interface : {gap} Uh {disfmarker} For channels it's not handy ,
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : because you scroll too fast .
Industrial Designer : And uh the L_C_D_ . So we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ .
Marketing : Mm {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I don't think that's an opportunity . Just skip it . Because we don't have time for that to to put it in .
Industrial Designer : Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . Because we use scroll wheels .
Project Manager : Yeah , okay .
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : And um {disfmarker} Yeah , that was it I guess .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Oh just sk
Industrial Designer : We haven't decided yet .
Project Manager : Maybe you have to skip that one as well . It's {disfmarker}
User Interface : Uh I don't think a rubber case looks {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : L
Marketing : Uh but we have to do something about the trend .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , i it it should be soft . You said so ?
Marketing : The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh .
User Interface : Yeah , okay . That {disfmarker} Uh fruit and veg , or {disfmarker}
Marketing : And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two .
User Interface : Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers .
Marketing : Uh yeah i Just {disfmarker} Just on front .
User Interface : So you can {gap} the the spongy {disfmarker} yeah , I dunno . I can't imagine a soft remote control .
Project Manager : No .
Marketing : Neith uh I don't like it uh neither .
Project Manager : No . {gap} {vocalsound}
User Interface : I just can't imagine it .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} So just hard plastic ?
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , I think .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : Titanium . It's mentioned here uh .
Industrial Designer : Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive .
Project Manager : But maybe the form has to be a bit different . Not the sh the square form . Just a bit
Industrial Designer : Yeah ,
Project Manager : more rounded .
Industrial Designer : you can make it curved or mm round . But just in two D_ , not in depth .
Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah , that's right .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : ";yes;4;yes;5;yes;1;yes;4;yes;2;no;0;yes;3
"Project Manager : Oh .
User Interface : It's not saved yet .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Our beautiful drawing .
Project Manager : So just f um {disfmarker} So this is our agenda . You're {disfmarker} F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me .
Marketing : Oops .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Uh I didn't {disfmarker} Oh yeah . So these are the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Oh , okay . Yeah .
Project Manager : So these are the um last notes we I made . If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . I don't have to put it in the report .
User Interface : Are we doing the the speech recognition ? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well .
Project Manager : Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . So if you want to , it's okay .
User Interface : Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in .
Project Manager : Okay , just {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? Or fold open ? I don't know .
Project Manager : Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls .
Industrial Designer : It's probably better . Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you {gap} other functions .
User Interface : {vocalsound} It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well .
Project Manager : Maybe that's better . Yeah , that's that's a very good point .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside .
Industrial Designer : Think that's better .
User Interface : So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it .
Project Manager : Yeah . Okay . So this is okay ? {gap}
User Interface : {gap} No . Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then .
Project Manager : Okay , so that's {disfmarker} Uh I'll just have a look how much that is .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} The {disfmarker}
Project Manager : But um {disfmarker} Okay , for the {disfmarker}
User Interface : Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I I think so . I don't know .
Project Manager : No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So {disfmarker}
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Ah okay .
Project Manager : So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay .
User Interface : Good .
Project Manager : So you can show your prototype if you want to .
User Interface : Together ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , it's {disfmarker} Let's do it together .
User Interface : I'll give comments .
Industrial Designer : Okay . Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements . Uh the look-and-feel model . Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . Simply a square with uh round corners . So that's basically it . {vocalsound} Uh the material should be hard plastic . Uh colour changeable , and also transparent .
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . Um then the elements . Uh we have {disfmarker} The functions are just basic . Like uh I've pointed them here . Mute function , on-off function , text functions . This uh switch channel .
Project Manager : Okay , cool . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : And this is the the num-pad . And the logo is over here , and the mic .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : And the scrollwheel , no ? You operate that with your pointing finger .
Marketing : Means {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : So you hold it like this in your right hand and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Mm . So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ?
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Speech recognition .
Project Manager : Yeah , speech recognition . Just {disfmarker} Only one button to say it's on or off .
User Interface : Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something .
Industrial Designer : Uh I dunno .
User Interface : Um so I've {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it .
User Interface : Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore .
Project Manager : So you can put it on the back as well if you want to .
User Interface : Yeah , you can {gap} put 'em all on the back . That's for sure .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : That's uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad .
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . But {disfmarker} You have a lot of room if you can slide it open .
Project Manager : Yeah , you can put it separate .
User Interface : You {disfmarker} Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So {disfmarker} But it's enough room .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Um the position ? Yeah , you write uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : Uh well {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : You wrote this , so .
User Interface : Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central . That was the the most important thing .
Marketing : {gap}
User Interface : So uh the best {gap} place , the best reach place {disfmarker} Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's {vocalsound} basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Just just one thing now . Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine .
User Interface : Okay yeah , they {gap} {disfmarker}
Marketing : But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes .
Industrial Designer : Mm yeah .
User Interface : Yeah okay . That's that's below that then .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay .
User Interface : It's uh twelve buttons .
Industrial Designer : {gap} just so you get that .
Marketing : Okay , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's rather important . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah okay , just we just missed that .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah .
User Interface : But um I'll just uh {disfmarker} I'll get back to later . F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . So um should be popular . Um {disfmarker} The f uh the buttons creating ? Uh if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling . Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons . Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh {vocalsound} in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it .
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : And also in the num-pads , there's also colour {gap} light behind it .
Project Manager : And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ?
User Interface : So when you pre Yeah .
Project Manager : How do you want to implement that ? Just on the {disfmarker} Maybe on the second level as well ?
User Interface : We're going to implement . Yeah . Mm just a little {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , these are just basic functions , so {disfmarker}
Marketing : Ah .
Industrial Designer : All the non-basic are in {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Okay . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing : Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player .
Industrial Designer : Okay , maybe we use this button for the {disfmarker}
Marketing : That function must be {disfmarker} Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions .
User Interface : Yeah ,
Project Manager : Yeah , as well .
User Interface : I um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Just make make a {gap} {disfmarker}
User Interface : To your video device .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} A second level ?
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Like a a new blank one or {disfmarker} Or just here ?
Project Manager : No no , just on {disfmarker} Down there .
User Interface : Is i Ah okay .
Project Manager : So uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Okay . Yeah .
Marketing : And h how does the second level come out ?
Project Manager : Just uh if you s
Marketing : Uh it slides uh along ?
User Interface : Um slides I think .
Project Manager : Yeah , y Maybe , yeah .
User Interface : It's
Marketing : From from the uh beneath ?
Project Manager : For the bottom .
User Interface : You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough .
Project Manager : No , you gotta slide it .
User Interface : If that breaks then you're screwed .
Project Manager : Yeah , it's right .
User Interface : So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : So what do we need ?
User Interface : Uh i the the speech functions buttons .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , just {disfmarker}
Marketing : Menu ?
User Interface : Menu button . With uh maybe uh arrows . So you can uh
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : scroll in the , navigate the menu . Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : God damn it .
Marketing : Scart ?
User Interface : {gap} I think we can even put a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels .
Marketing : Uh yeah . And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left . Yes . {vocalsound}
User Interface : So you have one left for the {disfmarker} Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often .
Industrial Designer : So this is the {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day .
Industrial Designer : {gap}
Marketing : {vocalsound} It's a f {vocalsound} basic uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Extern or something .
User Interface : {gap}
Project Manager : You want to save that file as well ? The drawing ?
User Interface : That was it .
Industrial Designer : So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many .
User Interface : Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Doesn't really matter . Just just uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : It doesn't really matter .
Industrial Designer : I don't know the functions .
User Interface : That's {disfmarker} Yeah well we don't have any uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Okay . What else ?
User Interface : Hmm ?
Industrial Designer : What else ?
User Interface : What else ? Uh menu buttons with arrows .
Industrial Designer : Uh menu .
Marketing : Yeah , to navigate .
User Interface : S Just uh like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Uh {gap} With arrows .
User Interface : Um I think it's best if we do . Mm where do we have {disfmarker} Or there .
Industrial Designer : Like a normal um {disfmarker}
User Interface : Like on the normal uh {disfmarker} Like this .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , with in the middle um a menu button .
User Interface : The menu button , yes .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . So you can't redesign it .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Mm okay .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ?
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yep .
Marketing : Uh and and you can hold it ,
Project Manager : {gap}
Marketing : you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Just press it once , the colour should uh switch . Press again , the colour switch again maybe ?
Marketing : {gap} okay .
Project Manager : Or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it . Just red , yel uh red , green and {disfmarker}
Marketing : Okay , yeah . Th Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay .
Marketing : If we have enough place , uh then we can do that .
Project Manager : That's that's very easy , yeah .
Industrial Designer : We can put those here .
Marketing : Colour buttons . And then we choose green , uh blue and red or
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yep .
Marketing : {disfmarker} Okay .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : Okay . That's uh {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : So did we miss anything ?
User Interface : Yeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume .
Marketing : It {disfmarker} Some text uh buttons .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Marketing : Yeah , but
Project Manager : No , ma on on o on the on the {disfmarker}
User Interface : I just uh {disfmarker} The volume logo .
Marketing : there's one there's one text button I {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Oh wh Here ?
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah . {gap}
Project Manager : Just make it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Okay . Yeah , or th or the {disfmarker}
Marketing : There's one text button I prefer . That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text .
User Interface : Yeah , we have that on the the text button .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : Do you do you {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yep .
Marketing : Did you think of that ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then {disfmarker}
User Interface : Uh why not ?
Project Manager : Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well .
Marketing : Ex Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface : No {disfmarker} Whoa {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Well w we thought of a text button . And if you press it again , you get the the the
User Interface : I think um {disfmarker}
Marketing : The sta the state you {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Oh just three stages , you {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : through view .
Project Manager : Yeah , that's okay .
User Interface : Yeah , the three stages . Yes .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So you can switch back from second to w first .
User Interface : No , it doesn't have to turn it off . Just don't {gap} {disfmarker}
Marketing : No . Just remember where it was .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ?
Project Manager : Yes , that's to remember .
Industrial Designer : Okay , okay .
Project Manager : Yeah , but that's that's uh {disfmarker}
Marketing : But maybe it's not the way {disfmarker}
User Interface : I dunno if {gap} {disfmarker}
Project Manager : That's a functionality for the television . {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah , I think as well , but {disfmarker} Uh yeah .
Marketing : Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about .
Industrial Designer : Yeah mm nee uh {disfmarker} No , if i {vocalsound} uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on .
User Interface : Yeah , in thi the the remote control in the
Project Manager : Okay . Yeah , but you have to search every time again .
User Interface : the chip .
Industrial Designer : Th i
Project Manager : That's what what happening if you do it like that . But it's still the television that has to do that .
User Interface : Yeah , that's true .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , I dunno . Okay .
User Interface : So yeah . Um do we need to fix that or {disfmarker}
Project Manager : No , that's what the television does .
Marketing : Mm {vocalsound} most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , those memory functions .
Marketing : But uh not not every every television , so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay , it's cool .
Industrial Designer : Was uh this logo for uh volume ?
Project Manager : Yeah , that's fine .
Industrial Designer : Okay . So that's it ?
Project Manager : Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ?
Marketing : Yeah , I I thought about one thing . Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ?
Industrial Designer : Mm . No no
User Interface : Just like your telephone , hard plastic .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . Just hard plastic . So {disfmarker}
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway .
Marketing : Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are uh {disfmarker} And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ?
User Interface : I think just on the buttons .
Industrial Designer : Uh I think just um {disfmarker}
User Interface : If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space .
Marketing : Well yeah . That's too much place .
User Interface : I don't think the space is worth it .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , but {disfmarker}
Marketing : Okay , just leave it . Just leave it .
Industrial Designer : I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons .
Marketing : Yeah , and i The most time {disfmarker} Yeah , with rubber buttons . Yeah , okay . {gap} Okay . Fine .
Project Manager : Yeah ? Okay , cool . Mm mm mm mm mm . Yeah , I don't know what this means . But I think we just evela evaluated this one .
Marketing : Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model .
Project Manager : Oh okay , you made some criteria . Okay , cool . Okay .
Marketing : I d d d I don't think if it's right . {vocalsound} That shall show it .
Project Manager : You have some usability criteria or {disfmarker}
Marketing : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : Uh no , uh all criterias we just argue about . Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : In the bottom .
Marketing : Oh .
Project Manager : Look-and-feel ?
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : No , evaluation is {disfmarker}
Marketing : Evaluation crit Yeah , evaluation presentation . It's not in . Uh d it doesn't matter um {disfmarker} It only had two pages or something . {vocalsound} Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . The Italians uh , how they think about it . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : um {vocalsound} model .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : And this {disfmarker} These are all I I I found , or I wrote down . And um {vocalsound} we have to discuss about {vocalsound} , if we give it a one or a seven .
Project Manager : Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea . It quite beautiful .
Marketing : Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : It's {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yes .
Project Manager : We are actu We are the {disfmarker}
User Interface : Mm .
Marketing : Yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something . And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and {vocalsound} and that kind of stuff .
Project Manager : Flashy .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Okay . Well I think we do {disfmarker}
Marketing : The LEDs .
User Interface : If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think .
Marketing : Yes .
Project Manager : But uh {disfmarker}
Marketing : And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste .
User Interface : Hmm ?
Marketing : The basic colours are black or green or yellow ?
User Interface : Um basic colours ,
Marketing : Or you haven't thought about {disfmarker}
User Interface : um yeah . Well you didn't say .
Marketing : Ho how do we make uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : Maybe um company colours ?
Project Manager : It's black .
User Interface : Black .
Marketing : Black and yellow .
Project Manager : Yeah , yellow light .
User Interface : A bit a bit of yellow .
Marketing : Can {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Do we have yellow light ? No , not really , but it's possible .
User Interface : Not not not yellow {gap} , but just a bit of light yellow .
Project Manager : It's {disfmarker}
Marketing : Black white , maybe ?
User Interface : Like white , also ni or uh always nice .
Industrial Designer : And what colours should the buttons be ?
Marketing : Uh {disfmarker} Because um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , different colours . This is {disfmarker}
User Interface : Just um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Oh , the same as th th the cover . But also th the light behind it .
User Interface : Yes .
Industrial Designer : But can you change those too , with uh the switch ?
Project Manager : No , no . Make them {disfmarker} No , just make them black or grey or something .
User Interface : Yeah , grey . Just dark grey I think .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Marketing : Okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours .
User Interface : Well we have changeable fronts , so {disfmarker}
Marketing : Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful .
User Interface : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , just give it a one . It's okay .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : It's perfect . I think it's just what you want . Or not ? {vocalsound}
User Interface : It's hard to decide for us , but yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah . It's ju so subjective .
User Interface : It it's {disfmarker} At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls .
Project Manager : Okay , just give it a two . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yeah . A two . Okay . The fancy look-and-feel . That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Okay . And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : One more thing .
Marketing : So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Are w are we changing uh {disfmarker} Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ? Or n no back light ?
Marketing : Slide panel ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah ?
Project Manager : No . No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers
User Interface : Mm . Not needed {gap} .
Project Manager : and uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , not needed I think .
Industrial Designer : And and the switch channel is uh {disfmarker} There is a back light too ?
Project Manager : That as well , yeah .
Marketing : Oh , you mean th this here ?
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah , but that's unnecessary .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
User Interface : What do I think is necessary necessary item ?
Marketing : It's pretty cool . If you slide it open , {vocalsound} it lights up . That's that's really fancy , but {vocalsound} I don't know if it's reachable .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Of course it's reachable .
Project Manager : It doesn't make {disfmarker}
Marketing : Then we do it . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up .
Industrial Designer : Hmm . {vocalsound}
User Interface : So you can see what's really there . Not just not re on the buttons or something .
Project Manager : No . Yeah .
User Interface : Just a green light or some blue light . To light it all up .
Marketing : Yeah ,
Project Manager : But {disfmarker} Yeah . Mayb Okay .
Marketing : but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , just backlight . Not not the buttons .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . So the buttons are just grey .
User Interface : Well yeah . Uh semi-transparent .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : Yeah , just only {disfmarker} Yeah , that's right .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Marketing : Okay , fine . So I I think it's very fancy .
Project Manager : So {disfmarker} Yeah , that's how I think .
User Interface : Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so {disfmarker}
Marketing : So I'll give it a {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Ye
Marketing : Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , this {disfmarker} It is a one .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : It's okay . It's cool .
Marketing : I think it's one . Okay , next .
Project Manager : This is a difficult one , because we we don't {disfmarker} Yeah , we don't know it about the {disfmarker}
Marketing : {vocalsound} Learnable ? Easy to use ? Yeah , we shall test it {vocalsound} But uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Uh {vocalsound} it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : It's {disfmarker} That's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : No , but you don't have to use that .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer .
Project Manager : No .
Industrial Designer : That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it .
User Interface : So I think it's easy to use , but {disfmarker} And learnable is a bit {disfmarker}
Marketing : Learnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control .
Industrial Designer : Well , I think it is .
Marketing : Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel .
User Interface : Well y just uh f
Marketing : I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or
Project Manager : But the rest of it is very easy ,
Marketing : {disfmarker} Uh then the re
Project Manager : because there are so so n
User Interface : Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does .
Industrial Designer : So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function .
User Interface : Yes .
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use .
Marketing : Okay .
User Interface : {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker}
Marketing : But {disfmarker}
Project Manager : And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device .
Marketing : Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ?
User Interface : Device .
Marketing : And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it . And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls .
Project Manager : But {disfmarker} yeah .
Marketing : 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um {vocalsound} easy to use .
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : Because easy to use comes after learnable .
Project Manager : Okay , just {disfmarker} Easy to use is very cool ,
Marketing : I I think it a three or something .
Project Manager : so just give it a two .
User Interface : Maybe three then . Learnable's {disfmarker}
Project Manager : No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah .
Industrial Designer : Mm uh . The normal .
User Interface : Yeah okay . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yep , true . Then a two .
Marketing : Oh . Okay .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound}
Marketing : New features . Techno technological innovative ?
Industrial Designer : The speech function and the colour . Colour .
Marketing : {vocalsound} The speech function is new .
User Interface : And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide .
Marketing : The scrollwheel and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new .
Project Manager : Slide is not n is is not new . No . I already have a {disfmarker}
Marketing : Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control .
Project Manager : Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it .
Marketing : Okay .
Project Manager : So that's not new .
User Interface : But also slide that buttons come out , as well ?
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : Okay , and the the the lightning ?
Project Manager : That's cool .
Marketing : Is that new ?
Project Manager : Yeah for a {disfmarker} Uh for a f
Marketing : The lighting's new .
User Interface : Yes .
Industrial Designer : Mm it's pretty new , I think .
Marketing : Scrollwheel . Speech ?
Industrial Designer : Speech is new .
User Interface : Different colours , so {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Marketing : So we have a pretty new uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : There are no games on it , that's that's {disfmarker} It's not a one , it's a two again .
User Interface : That would {disfmarker} And we didn't uh {disfmarker}
Marketing : It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something .
User Interface : But then we also have the the home station .
Project Manager : If you have {disfmarker}
User Interface : We are forgetting about that now , but {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah . Oh yeah , that's right . Rechargeable .
Marketing : Uh-oh .
User Interface : We don't
Marketing : Home-station .
User Interface : recharge .
Industrial Designer : Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but {disfmarker}
User Interface : But that's more like uh now .
Project Manager : Yeah , just draw it afterwards . {gap}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing .
User Interface : I don't know .
Project Manager : If you {disfmarker} Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project uh map ?
User Interface : Uh {disfmarker} Just save , save as ?
Project Manager : Yeah . Mm-hmm . Uh save as ? No , that's not in the project .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Well it's a already in the folder . L like number seven .
Project Manager : Oh yeah , okay . Smart board .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah , but this one .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : This one is not yet in the {disfmarker} Oh oh .
Industrial Designer : I think it is .
Project Manager : {gap}
Marketing : {gap}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah , it is .
Industrial Designer : No , I think it is .
User Interface : Uh untitled ?
Project Manager : {gap}
User Interface : Yeah , it doesn't matter . Save .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : But you still have to draw the resi the recharger .
Marketing : Uh all {vocalsound} the the seven , uh all the seven .
Project Manager : Okay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? No , I think i if you have games on ";yes;4;yes;5;yes;2;yes;3;yes;4;no;0;yes;3
"Project Manager : G good morning .
User Interface : Good morning , Flores . Marketing Expert .
Project Manager : Oh yeah .
User Interface : Right .
Project Manager : Are you ready ? You should put the laptop uh right into the square .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : For i for the cameras , yes .
User Interface : For the cameras Alright .
Project Manager : Good morning , Sebastian .
Industrial Designer : Good morning , {vocalsound} Mister P_M_ .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {gap} {disfmarker} I'm fine .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it .
User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Geez .
Project Manager : So {disfmarker} Do you want to open it as read-only .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um I guess I should close it here .
User Interface : You have the same message of uh Windows cannot um
Marketing : {gap}
User Interface : sen oh stand-by . Close the the window .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Okay .
Project Manager : Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud .
User Interface : So {disfmarker} That's right . Ruud .
Project Manager : Um project kick-off .
Industrial Designer : Is there a schedule for this meeting ?
Project Manager : Yes , there is actually . Um I will li list the agenda for today . For this meeting . Good morning , Ruud .
Marketing : Good morning . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Uh it's important um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I shall close the door .
Project Manager : yeah , great . It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras . Okay . Okay . Um we're here to develop uh a new product .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Um {vocalsound} and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . Um you are here in a specific role . Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . Is that correct ?
Industrial Designer : That's correct .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Um {vocalsound} we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion . Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind .
User Interface : Alright .
Industrial Designer : Okay . Um is there any room for a little presentation ? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ?
Project Manager : There is ? Yeah , there is .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} No problem .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it's a remote control , a television remote control . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . {vocalsound} Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : The market , we should have a look at the market . Um {vocalsound} we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the {gap} {disfmarker} the the progressions , yes .
User Interface : Progressions . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific {disfmarker} uh specification of that . Um {vocalsound} the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .
User Interface : It's for the vision . Yeah .
Project Manager : Um and the last one is the working design . How exactly does it work in the technical sense . Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . So we'll kop it {disfmarker} keep it with the functional design . {vocalsound} Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . Um as you see now I can give a presentation . {vocalsound} Um it's also possible to use this one as well . You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . Um {vocalsound} to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . Um then we have this electronic white-board system . {vocalsound} Um yeah , I will show that now . Um you can draw on the board using this pen . There are little um uh
User Interface : Sensors .
Project Manager : sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end . Um well , it {disfmarker} it's on the um eraser now , so we click the pen button . Okay , so not too fast writing . Um {vocalsound} you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . It's quite the same . Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . So do not m make a new file . Just use this one uh during the day . {vocalsound} Um you can use the eraser to make something go away .
User Interface : But we all use the same white-board file
Project Manager : Yes .
User Interface : So we can work together on it while we're {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : or should we only use it in the in the meetings ?
Project Manager : Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .
User Interface : Yeah , okay .
Project Manager : It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard .
User Interface : Yeah , alright . Yep .
Project Manager : Um you can choose the format , um {disfmarker} sorry . Uh {disfmarker} Let me see . Um {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected . Yep . Current colour , you can choose another colour . And um for example black , and you c I can choose the line width . Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour . Okay . Quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me . Um {vocalsound} to um {disfmarker} oh well , I'm {disfmarker} I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us . Um as a little training {vocalsound} um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Okay . Um green .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : An animal . Okay . Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Uh a wee rabbit .
User Interface : It's a bunny . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : A rabbit . Okay , well great .
Industrial Designer : Alright .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width .
User Interface : But of course , Flores .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Blank .
Project Manager : Sebastian is thinking about the animal .
Industrial Designer : I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Yeah , I'm think about it too . {vocalsound} Format {gap} . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but {vocalsound} it works ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well , I'll give it a try . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah .
Project Manager : It it should be a cat .
User Interface : right ?
Project Manager : Okay ?
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Mm .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} I'm guessing a horse .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Very good . {vocalsound}
User Interface : With a very small {vocalsound} legs . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I was very good in drawing . {vocalsound}
User Interface : You should feed that uh that animal . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well , I guess you uh get the idea . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yes , okay . {vocalsound} Beautiful .
Industrial Designer : Beautiful .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . Um any questions {disfmarker} well , just just let me know . Um okay , back to our project . Um {vocalsound} the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number . {vocalsound} Um
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , {vocalsound} um because uh , well , those are important numbers . Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation .
Industrial Designer : Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh
Project Manager : Limitations .
Industrial Designer : influations influences .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : Okay , great .
Industrial Designer : Okay ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one . {vocalsound} Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but {disfmarker} well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device {disfmarker} diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .
User Interface : And for a cell phone ?
Industrial Designer : Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
User Interface : Yeah , okay . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .
User Interface : But {disfmarker} Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so
Industrial Designer : But it's cost-effective . Yes . Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all .
User Interface : y you you can {disfmarker} Most of them .
Industrial Designer : So that's the point .
User Interface : Or you shou sh use a {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .
Industrial Designer : Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : but take these things into account when you start the discussion .
Project Manager : Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability ,
Industrial Designer : Yes ,
Project Manager : and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment ,
Project Manager : Okay , and and uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : and the way of communicating with these equipments .
Project Manager : Okay . Okay , good .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Um {vocalsound} that was your presentation ? Okay , okay .
Industrial Designer : That's it .
Project Manager : Um {vocalsound} okay . Great . Um {vocalsound} I'll go back to my own presentation . Um {disfmarker} Mm . Okay . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um {vocalsound} how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?
User Interface : Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um {disfmarker} Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?
Project Manager : Yep .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store .
Industrial Designer : Yes , I think it should be something like that .
User Interface : It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,
Project Manager : Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,
User Interface : right ?
Project Manager : not {disfmarker} we're we're {disfmarker} it's not a {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh {disfmarker} don't have the information for it .
Industrial Designer : We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?
Project Manager : No . No .
Industrial Designer : No ,
User Interface : No , okay .
Industrial Designer : we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Uh Ruud , y do you agree ?
Marketing : Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah .
Project Manager : Okay . Okay .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well , the techni fu technical function uh {gap} {disfmarker} what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . That's just the basic f technical function .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : So that was my {disfmarker} really my part for uh this session . Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface : Well , that's just the fu the technical function is {vocalsound} pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : It just should change the T_V_'s state .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : So that's it . Um but furthermore {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?
User Interface : Yeah . Yeah , with buttons .
Industrial Designer : Or are there any o other controls ?
User Interface : Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Are there only {disfmarker} any other cont Well , {vocalsound}
User Interface : But {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Uh-huh .
Industrial Designer : You know these things . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch {disfmarker}
User Interface : They're very vu vulnerable .
Industrial Designer : w yes ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . So maybe that's an idea ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : I don't know .
User Interface : And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ ,
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : so you must {vocalsound} point everywhere , so maybe infrared is {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Maybe not even pointed . Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .
Project Manager : Okay
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Uh is that uh {disfmarker} are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .
User Interface : Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or {disfmarker} yeah . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that ,
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in {disfmarker} outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : But {disfmarker} Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : um {disfmarker}
User Interface : Two more things .
Project Manager : okay .
User Interface : Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand .
Project Manager : Okay , s yeah .
User Interface : You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um {vocalsound} in dark too .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : So when it's dark {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Those are two really uh user interface {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . Is tha {vocalsound}
User Interface : Yeah . {gap} {disfmarker} That's perfect . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting .
Industrial Designer : Do do you {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the {disfmarker} such a product ? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?
Marketing : Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .
Project Manager : Because ?
Marketing : Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : But uh lots of devices already use infrared . So {disfmarker} we'll probably have to implement that .
Project Manager : Okay . Okay . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?
Industrial Designer : Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago ,
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : but I've seem to forget them {disfmarker} {vocalsound} forgot them . Um {disfmarker} oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it .
User Interface : Yeah . Well , maybe I um {disfmarker} but it it can be quite simple ,
Industrial Designer : I I don't know .
User Interface : you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Okay .
User Interface : The uh the the digits in black .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : Uh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {disfmarker} well , it can be for design , of course .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yes , but there's a cost limitation too .
Project Manager : Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : Well , that's more {disfmarker}
Project Manager : twelve Euro fifty , yeah .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : The cost price is very low .
User Interface : Just remind something .
Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker}
User Interface : The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade .
Project Manager : Okay , okay .
User Interface : You have a m uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Okay . Very good point . Yeah .
User Interface : Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . The marks .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Okay .
Project Manager : um or it should not consume too much um power . Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or {disfmarker}
User Interface : But um {disfmarker} Necessary , yeah .
Project Manager : yeah . I dunno , it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that's more Sebastian's uh um {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem .
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
User Interface : 'Cause I think Bluetooth uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} It's use uh a lot of uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Well does it ?
User Interface : Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .
Industrial Designer : well {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I'm not sure . Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's {disfmarker} it seems to work uh quite okay .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So uh technically it will be possible .
User Interface : But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .
Project Manager : Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time .
User Interface : Does it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : No , you cannot .
User Interface : {vocalsound} It's over ?
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so this was it .
User Interface : Okay .
Project Manager : See you in thirty minutes .
User Interface : Great .";yes;4;yes;4;yes;2;yes;2;yes;2;no;0;yes;3
"Project Manager : Welcome back .
User Interface : Hello .
Marketing : Hello .
Project Manager : Uh let me see .
User Interface : There's one of mine .
Project Manager : Okay . Roo , welcome back .
User Interface : Hello , Flores .
Project Manager : The waiting is for Sebastian .
User Interface : {gap} .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : There he is .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Is there any time for a cup of coffee ?
User Interface : We have a slight problem . {vocalsound} I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys .
Project Manager : Sorry ?
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Can I get a cup of coffee ?
Project Manager : Uh no . You can't ,
Industrial Designer : Okay . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : sorry .
User Interface : So just cancel it .
Industrial Designer : {gap} Well , during my work I have no time either .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Well ,
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : this is life . {vocalsound} Sorry uh , Roo .
User Interface : Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box . {vocalsound} Accidentally .
Project Manager : Okay . Okay . People , welcome back with the second meeting .
User Interface : But it's alright .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Um for now on the schedule are a few points . Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . Um second , I received um some new project requirements . I'm not sure if you received them as well , um but I will tell you about it .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ?
Industrial Designer : I think so too .
Project Manager : Roo ?
User Interface : Yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Ruud ?
Marketing : Almost . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Almost , okay .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . Um the top goal of this m
User Interface : But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Um we will figure that out . Ca {vocalsound} can you try to {disfmarker}
User Interface : Okay .
Marketing : Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the {gap} .
Project Manager : Yeah , w we will see .
User Interface : I don't think it's wireless here .
Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} it is , yeah . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : It is .
User Interface : Or it is . Yeah ?
Industrial Designer : It is .
User Interface : Okay , great .
Marketing : Uh okay .
Project Manager : Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um {vocalsound} we have forty minutes . So it's now {disfmarker} Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product . {vocalsound} It's a board decision . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : uh uh {disfmarker} we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with .
User Interface : Time , yeah .
Project Manager : Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , {vocalsound} which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um {vocalsound} then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product .
User Interface : Yes .
Project Manager : Is that clear ? Any questions on these requirements ? No ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?
User Interface : Yeah , I'll start .
Project Manager : Uh uh yeah . Okay ,
Industrial Designer : Yes .
Project Manager : great .
User Interface : Um {disfmarker} Oh , how can I uh {disfmarker} Geez , and sli and show . Um {disfmarker} Just uh press it .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Uh yes . Alright . Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . {vocalsound} Uh the method of the remote control is just {disfmarker} the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion .
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Um but um {disfmarker} yeah . My personal preferences were ease of uh {disfmarker} the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh {disfmarker} it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than {disfmarker} less than forty years old .
Project Manager : Uh-huh .
User Interface : So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my {disfmarker} in {gap} my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .
Project Manager : Okay . Uh Ruud , did you get that ?
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah , uh b uh most .
Project Manager : Okay , so
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : the important thing here is {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound} And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic .
Marketing : Oh , user-friendly .
Project Manager : In the market , yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , what what does the market want ? I I don't know .
Project Manager : Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .
Project Manager : Yeah . Okay . Sebastian .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Excuse me . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Scusi . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Um {disfmarker} Okay , it's still the right thing . Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here ,
User Interface : Energies and uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : but it's hardly readable . Can you see it ?
Project Manager : No , it's not visible .
Industrial Designer : No ? Well {disfmarker} Um , there's a energy source here . {vocalsound} And um basically there {disfmarker} it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . {vocalsound} Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . {vocalsound} It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w
User Interface : The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .
Industrial Designer : yes . In the {disfmarker} and it's a little more {disfmarker} a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah . Okay .
Industrial Designer : Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . {vocalsound} So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment .
Project Manager : So it's fairly easy .
Industrial Designer : There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before ,
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Succeed in it also .
Industrial Designer : and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Okay ,
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so uh
Project Manager : good .
Industrial Designer : personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . So I think that uh should be clear .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . {vocalsound} Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .
User Interface : {vocalsound} And what's the um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I think our uh users will really uh will really like that .
User Interface : if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also .
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : So we can use them . So that's no problem .
User Interface : For the same costs , it's can be uh in our {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making {disfmarker}
User Interface : Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : We can we can make its I think .
Marketing : Well you could only lit uh the buttons {disfmarker} the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .
Marketing : Or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : But I think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
User Interface : Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons ,
Marketing : Hmm , true . {vocalsound}
User Interface : and not for {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yes . Well , it's not one light , it {disfmarker} there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device .
User Interface : Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .
Industrial Designer : No no no , no . That's right , that's right .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} well , this uh should be it .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Um have a think about it .
Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , Ruud .
Marketing : Oh , mine is already outdated .
Project Manager : Okay well ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product .
Marketing : {vocalsound} Since uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : So any income is welcome . {vocalsound} Input .
Marketing : Okay , make {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . Of {gap} {disfmarker} of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Could you step a little bit more to the right ? {vocalsound} Yeah , thank you . {vocalsound}
Marketing : But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Uh well , skip this . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Well , it's {disfmarker} this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the {disfmarker} about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control .
Industrial Designer : Mm .
Marketing : So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones .
Project Manager : Okay . Well , that's interesting .
Marketing : Or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Or a find {disfmarker} a finding function ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : you know .
Project Manager : that's definitely interesting .
Industrial Designer : That's quite a {disfmarker} yes .
Project Manager : It uh it separates our product from others uh as well .
User Interface : Sound signal .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Okay ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : go on .
Industrial Designer : Yes .
Marketing : Well , I just said that . And uh {disfmarker} well , this obvious , and he also said it .
Project Manager : Okay . So that's what the market tells us .
Marketing : Uh that's about it , yes .
Project Manager : Yep . Okay .
User Interface : The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used .
Marketing : Uh mo uh zap buttons most .
User Interface : So {disfmarker}
Marketing : Volume , they are {gap} uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , well it should just have a design {disfmarker} The perfect design for those {disfmarker} only those buttons . And first um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yes . Yes , we should focus on that , I guess .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Yep .
Industrial Designer : Well , the technical uh {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .
User Interface : Yeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering , {vocalsound} the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ?
Industrial Designer : Well
Marketing : Yeah , that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a problem . Yeah . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Yes . {vocalsound} Th that's a bit of {disfmarker} that's a problem .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Another device is not a solution .
Project Manager : Well
Industrial Designer : Usually {disfmarker}
Project Manager : maybe maybe like clapping in your hands ,
User Interface : It should be uh uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : like um turning on and off the the the lights .
Industrial Designer : Oh yes .
User Interface : Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .
Industrial Designer : Yes . Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep .
Project Manager : Reports rep respend response to it .
Industrial Designer : And um {disfmarker}
User Interface : just like uh the phones Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : Yes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing .
User Interface : the {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : But uh th
User Interface : But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : No , so we we should use something else .
Marketing : And you {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home um {disfmarker}
User Interface : But I believe you will have an {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , and usually {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : We do not control the T_V_ set so well .
Marketing : And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ ,
Industrial Designer : Yes , m yes . S and we b we want {gap} to make so it's {gap} {disfmarker} is easy as possible for our customers ,
Marketing : and it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : so we should think about {disfmarker}
Project Manager : So what about the clapping technique ? Um because you se
User Interface : I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} It's quite complicated . Well , it's quite complicated . Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .
Marketing : {vocalsound} And b
Project Manager : Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound ,
Project Manager : Yeah , a peak . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .
Marketing : So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .
Project Manager : Yeah , that's true .
Industrial Designer : Yes ,
User Interface : But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something .
Industrial Designer : so we don't want that .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Maybe we can {disfmarker} Something like that .
User Interface : Well if you lost th
Industrial Designer : Well ,
Project Manager : Well uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : is there not something f something more easily {disfmarker}
User Interface : I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the {disfmarker} their remote .
Industrial Designer : Well , I don't think uh {gap} .
User Interface : Uh that's just uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh {gap} . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : so w we should use have {disfmarker} uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .
User Interface : {gap} just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility .
Industrial Designer : Yes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think .
Project Manager : Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .
Industrial Designer : So that's not a good idea .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution ,
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . I will .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : because that's his {disfmarker} his field of expertise .
Industrial Designer : Yes . Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : um and it will become more costly also .
Project Manager : Yep .
Industrial Designer : Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp
User Interface : And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ?
Industrial Designer : Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .
User Interface : It's a unique item uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , it's a distinction in the market .
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker}
User Interface : It will be an {disfmarker} a unique feature of our remote control .
Project Manager : It's a different {disfmarker} exactly . It's an uni an unique feature ,
Marketing : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and {disfmarker} probably more i interesting than uh than the lights .
User Interface : And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um {vocalsound} an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : What should we choose in in design ?
Project Manager : Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often .
User Interface : Well , the extra functions .
Project Manager : So {disfmarker}
Marketing : I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most {disfmarker} the second-most used function .
User Interface : Used option .
Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Uh well {disfmarker} yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important .
Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .
Marketing : So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager : Well , we skip that .
Marketing : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff .
Industrial Designer : No , no .
Project Manager : No .
User Interface : So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing : Nope .
Industrial Designer : So that's out of the question .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it .
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one .
Industrial Designer : I think also . Yes . Well ,
Project Manager : No .
User Interface : So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface
Project Manager : Yeah . Okay ,
Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Ruud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple {disfmarker}
Marketing : Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh then they uh might ,
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
Marketing : 'cause young people uh like new features .
Project Manager : Mm yeah .
Marketing : So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right .
Project Manager : Okay , so this is is kind of uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Mm .
User Interface : Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .
Industrial Designer : Okay . Well , is it {disfmarker} maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Maybe it's more important to make the {disfmarker} make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless {disfmarker}
Project Manager : But but are we not in in the in the manual uh {disfmarker} I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise .
Project Manager : But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ?
User Interface : Yeah , I don't know yet . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Because we do not implement uh a user history .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system .
Project Manager : I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that .
Marketing : And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .
Project Manager : Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions .
Industrial Designer : Yes .
User Interface : But does it {disfmarker} uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well ,
Project Manager : Yeah , draw draw it on the board .
User Interface : should we just use a {disfmarker} Um it's already uh {disfmarker} oh , we have a blank . Oh .
Industrial Designer : yeah , something like that . Oh
User Interface : It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick .
Industrial Designer : It's not really a stick , but {disfmarker} Yes . Yes .
User Interface : A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down
Project Manager : Yeah , it can break down .
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
User Interface : or uh
Industrial Designer : Yes , yes .
User Interface : just a round uh button should be the trick , I think .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think .
Marketing : A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh .
Industrial Designer : But you're the marketing man .
Marketing : And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use .
User Interface : Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Uh-huh . {vocalsound}
User Interface : The programme up and down . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Okay , yeah .
User Interface : And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want .
Industrial Designer : Okay , that's good .
Project Manager : Okay , but w we still {vocalsound} we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's {disfmarker} um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have {disfmarker} has the information to discuss about that , I think .
Project Manager : Um well , for {disfmarker} we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah .
User Interface : Yes ?
Project Manager : We need to um have the uh the user function {disfmarker} uh the functions decided and um {vocalsound} uh our target audience .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay .
User Interface : but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'Kay ,
Industrial Designer : Okay . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ?
Project Manager : Um well , I do not want a full uh {disfmarker} it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting .
Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay .
User Interface : The ten digits .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . {gap} l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but {disfmarker}
User Interface : Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Yes .
Project Manager : Yeah . A bit of a split mode .
Industrial Designer : Change .
Project Manager : Uh l like {disfmarker} Yeah .
User Interface : {disfmarker} yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yes , yes .
Project Manager : Dual channel watch .
Industrial Designer : Yes .
Project Manager : Okay , well um
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : m maybe I should write that down . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : you're the secretary . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ?
Marketing : Mielsen .
Project Manager : Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh {disfmarker} Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Mm okay ,
User Interface : Alright .
Industrial Designer : but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah , that's that's {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : if you want to do it , Sebastian . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Sure . {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Okay , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Volume . Programme . Uh dual channel . Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yes , that's important .
Project Manager : And and do we want um the ten digits ?
User Interface : The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so .
Industrial Designer : Well , are are you sure ?
Marketing : Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button .
Industrial Designer : I'm not so sure .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Well , that's complicated ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think {disfmarker} but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so .
User Interface : I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the te";yes;4;yes;4;yes;3;yes;3;yes;2;no;0;yes;3
"Project Manager : {gap} Do you need to change anything on it ? Because otherwise I will already open it .
Marketing : Um {disfmarker} Mm , don't think so .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : Unless uh things have suddenly change again .
Project Manager : Is it much changes ?
Marketing : Uh don't know . Maybe uh you've got new information , {vocalsound} like uh last time .
Project Manager : Uh I didn't {disfmarker} No no . I do hot have {disfmarker} Only the same information . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} Okay .
Project Manager : Hello , Sebastian .
Industrial Designer : Hello hello Mister P_M_ .
Project Manager : I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well , in the control room .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well , that's where the thinking goes on . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Oh , it's that Roo again , always late .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Bongiorno .
Project Manager : Bongiorno .
Industrial Designer : I think you should punish him .
Project Manager : Hmm . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : You're the P_M_ . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Punish . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : I see some interesting {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : okay .
User Interface : You wish . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Possibilities , yeah ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} People , welcome back .
User Interface : Welcome . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : The third meeting . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Oop .
Project Manager : Um I have some points I would like to {disfmarker} uh some some issues I would like to point out . Um {vocalsound} first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ? If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : so I could {disfmarker} uh can uh um use that in the in the report . {vocalsound} Um the second thing , um {vocalsound} I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared . That's quite strange .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Yes .
Project Manager : Okay . We'll come to that later , I g I think .
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Um {vocalsound} the agenda for now {disfmarker} uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ?
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : No .
Industrial Designer : Not at all .
Project Manager : Okay . Um
Marketing : No .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . Forty minutes in total for this . So um {vocalsound} I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation .
Marketing : 'Kay . Hmm ?
User Interface : Alright .
Marketing : Oh .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {gap} .
Industrial Designer : Just press the okay button , it works .
Marketing : Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} Okay .
Project Manager : Um yeah .
Marketing : Yeah . Yeah . My method ? {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} How surprising . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Well , findings . Uh {disfmarker} Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture ,
User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing : and that they want spongy material . Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes {gap} uh m material . But we {disfmarker} since we are concentrating on uh the younger group {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Uh w wait a sec wait a se
Industrial Designer : Oh wait uh wait up .
Project Manager : uh could you go to the previous slide ? Um because I'm taking minutes
Marketing : 'Kay .
Project Manager : Um were the important themes enclose . Yeah {gap} okay . The feel of {gap} to be spongy {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?
Marketing : Well , uh one example given was this , so um I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .
Industrial Designer : Not something dull .
User Interface : But they like dark colours ,
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : you said in the p
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects .
User Interface : Okay . Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow .
Marketing : But {disfmarker}
User Interface : I had {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : But can you can you go back to that slide ? The {disfmarker} uh
Marketing : Which one ?
Industrial Designer : just one slide back ,
Marketing : This ?
Industrial Designer : no no no . Yes . Okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy .
Marketing : Yes .
Industrial Designer : Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} Uh well , it might .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . But {disfmarker} Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge .
Project Manager : Okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard . It it {disfmarker} maybe it rubber or or {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , exactly .
Project Manager : yeah . {vocalsound} Okay .
Marketing : Yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials ,
User Interface : Or we could make {disfmarker} oh .
Marketing : but that doesn't mean we should use wood , So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay .
Marketing : Well , this this is an example of what they would like . But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like .
Project Manager : Well , that's interesting .
Industrial Designer : It's quite interesting . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .
User Interface : Yeah , o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh {vocalsound} telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone .
Industrial Designer : Yes . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah , yeah .
User Interface : It's the it's the rubber uh cover .
Project Manager : Yeah , it is , it is i yeah .
User Interface : And it's uh colourful .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : It looks likes a banana . {vocalsound} We have the fruit , we have the colours . {vocalsound} We have the simple design .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Do you know the phone ?
Industrial Designer : I don't know the phone ,
Project Manager : It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five ,
Industrial Designer : but I can imagine it .
Project Manager : I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away ,
User Interface : Um thirty five .
Industrial Designer : Oh , that one , yes .
Project Manager : the very {disfmarker}
User Interface : And the b the light blue and {vocalsound} it's also in yellow .
Industrial Designer : Now I kn uh {disfmarker} oh , I know , I know . Yes , I I've seen it . I've seen it .
Project Manager : You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? About th
Marketing : I've seen it ,
Project Manager : Okay . Okay . Um uh
Marketing : but {disfmarker}
Project Manager : okay . Do you have {gap} {disfmarker} uh thit {disfmarker} that was {disfmarker}
Marketing : 'Kay . Uh that's about it .
Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the {disfmarker} our target group .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yes .
Project Manager : And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials .
Marketing : Uh soft material .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . And what was even more important ?
Marketing : Uh the fancy look and feel .
Industrial Designer : Okay . So that's the most important thing for our customers .
Marketing : Yes . Apparently .
Project Manager : Okay , Roo ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : could you do your presentation ?
User Interface : Mm-hmm . Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and {vocalsound} just um , well , a weird um shape .
Project Manager : Shape .
User Interface : So I suggest {disfmarker} I couldn't uh {disfmarker} I had a small uh mock-up uh {vocalsound} sign on the {vocalsound} on {gap} paper .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} But it didn't work . My pen didn't load um the information . So I made a really simple {vocalsound} f uh a shape on uh {disfmarker} in um PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : Yeah .
Project Manager : And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um {disfmarker} I mean this is how you hold a remote control .
Industrial Designer : Yes .
Project Manager : Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery ,
Industrial Designer : Slippery .
Project Manager : s because um {disfmarker}
User Interface : But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber .
Industrial Designer : You have to grab it .
Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah , exactly .
User Interface : So it's easy in your hand {disfmarker} Uh indeed .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,
Project Manager : Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : so you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier .
Project Manager : Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah , {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : So m Yes .
Project Manager : okay .
Industrial Designer : But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .
Project Manager : Okay , good .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Great . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on .
Project Manager : Yeah . Way too much I think for our goal ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : yeah .
User Interface : So if you have the voice recognition , you can {vocalsound} you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Okay , b but I think we'll {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Okay , but I'll I'll go into that ,
Project Manager : yeah .
Industrial Designer : because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a {disfmarker} it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . {vocalsound} We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that .
User Interface : Yeah . Right .
Industrial Designer : But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source {disfmarker} source . Which brings me to the different energy sources . {vocalsound} Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh {vocalsound} remote controls .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : You really have to imagine like {vocalsound} winding up your {disfmarker} uh
User Interface : {vocalsound} Great . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Well , it would be very new to the market ,
Industrial Designer : I d
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : It would be very new ,
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think .
Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well ,
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're {disfmarker} you you have to um make some kind of energy {disfmarker} kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish .
User Interface : Like the watch .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} It have {disfmarker} it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . And you can store the energy in the in the thing .
Project Manager : I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . It's very funny indeed .
Project Manager : I mean solar is {disfmarker} of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Indeed .
Project Manager : Um hand dynamo {disfmarker}
User Interface : But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Well , maybe m
User Interface : if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also .
Project Manager : Yeah , I know .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Yes .
User Interface : You you walk
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : and uh {disfmarker} but uh you {disfmarker} you're sitting on a couch .
Industrial Designer : But you know you know from your own watch {disfmarker} your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . {gap} the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a {disfmarker} in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something ,
Project Manager : Yeah . And wha
Industrial Designer : well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : So , but maybe {vocalsound} maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .
Project Manager : Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .
Industrial Designer : Uh yes , it does .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : I'll come to that later .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . {vocalsound} The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it . Um {vocalsound} uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently {disfmarker}
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer : uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four {disfmarker}
User Interface : Mm-hmm . Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yes . That is possible too . Yes .
User Interface : {gap} {disfmarker} But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels {disfmarker} I had some {disfmarker} I had some information about it too .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : I don't think {vocalsound} there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels .
Project Manager : Well {disfmarker}
User Interface : I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .
Industrial Designer : Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . Maybe when you integrate some functions .
Project Manager : This will be the remote , right ?
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Um with uh maybe a channel selector . What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?
User Interface : Yeah , uh that's a possibility ,
Industrial Designer : Uh it's do it's done before .
Project Manager : Because this is how you keep it {disfmarker}
User Interface : but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yes . It's quite quite good , yes .
User Interface : But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Volume ?
Industrial Designer : Well , it's it {disfmarker} well , i what he means is there's an {disfmarker} button integrated in the scroll-wheel .
User Interface : A volume , okay .
Industrial Designer : There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel .
Project Manager : Well , what about mute ?
Industrial Designer : About mute .
Project Manager : Thi i i m I guess uh th
Industrial Designer : Well , yes .
Project Manager : this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Okay . Yes . Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay .
Project Manager : And click it to muten the device .
Industrial Designer : Well , okay . It's quite goods .
Project Manager : And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Yes .
Project Manager : So maybe um {disfmarker} I guess that {disfmarker} that's something you two uh need to think about .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel .
Marketing : Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh well ,
User Interface : Wheel .
Marketing : it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : Hmm . {vocalsound} But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . We use this .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : And {disfmarker} Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now .
Project Manager : Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume .
Industrial Designer : So maybe it's not no {gap} .
Project Manager : Nokia has a {disfmarker} well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .
Industrial Designer : Hmm . Yes , but it uses two separate buttons .
Project Manager : Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : It doesn't use a {disfmarker} {gap} . Well . Uh something for uh Roo here . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : For you too , yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .
Industrial Designer : Wi within reach . Yes , you have to .
User Interface : So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .
Industrial Designer : Yes . {gap} yes . Yeah , yeah . Okay .
Project Manager : Okay . Sebastian . Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : There's {disfmarker} there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation . {vocalsound} About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .
User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah yeah , you can um {disfmarker} I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word {disfmarker} you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Okay . Okay . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}
User Interface : Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function
Industrial Designer : okay .
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Yeah .
User Interface : and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . that's the sample sensor . So So if you say mute , it says mute again ,
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : and then it's um {disfmarker} well , I believe it's uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : It performs the action . Yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what {disfmarker} which he believes it is .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : So you say mute , he repeats mute and you {disfmarker} makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . Okay . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . Um no op I'm not very sure . No , it's not in here . If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper .
Project Manager : Okay . Uh well {disfmarker} uh
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : d did we already decide on the display ? To {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about .
User Interface : Yeah . Well , I don't have um {disfmarker} I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information {disfmarker} uh y I don't think you need it on a display .
Project Manager : No .
User Interface : Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I I don't think either .
User Interface : 'cause uh {gap} uh all {disfmarker} any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen ,
Industrial Designer : No . I don't think you need it .
Project Manager : On screen display . Yeah .
User Interface : yeah .
Project Manager : Okay
Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay , well
Project Manager : th
Industrial Designer : my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the {disfmarker} a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper .
Project Manager : Okay . Good .
Industrial Designer : So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Kineti okay .
Industrial Designer : The kinetic thing it {gap} it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm {disfmarker} I think you should combine it with batteries .
Project Manager : Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,
Industrial Designer : Otherwise it will not {disfmarker} too advanced ,
Project Manager : too {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : uh well .
Project Manager : yeah .
Industrial Designer : It's {disfmarker} in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .
Project Manager : Yeah , but that {disfmarker} that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different .
Industrial Designer : But {disfmarker} Yes . And I think it's more robust .
Project Manager : Yeah . Okay .
Industrial Designer : It's more uh Uh it's more functional .
User Interface : But what about um the markets {vocalsound} uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? So if you use titanium {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : No no , but the uh um {disfmarker} that's what Sebastian said .
Industrial Designer : The titanium thing uh we have to skip it . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . But but yet , I understood that the market is different .
User Interface : Okay . Oh ,
Project Manager : So um {disfmarker}
User Interface : sorry . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : and we should uh use wood or something like that .
Project Manager : No ,
User Interface : And I would think {disfmarker}
Marketing : And
Project Manager : r
Marketing : yeah ,
Project Manager : rubber with colours .
Marketing : the {disfmarker} yeah , the older people liked wood .
Industrial Designer : Oh okay , sorry . So it it needs to be rubber .
Marketing : No the {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Colourful and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Marketing : Yeah , the younger people liked soft material .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Okay , spongy materials .
Marketing : Yeah . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy .
User Interface : And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} Yes , they can . But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple {disfmarker}
User Interface : Okay , but we also {disfmarker} uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Well , I'm not very sure . Maybe that's an uh {disfmarker} a different {disfmarker}
User Interface : oh ,
Project Manager : But but do we want the curved uh uh design ,
User Interface : evalu
Project Manager : or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {gap} I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull .
Project Manager : I it's too dull . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : I don't think c our customers will like it .
Marketing : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot {disfmarker} um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .
Project Manager : Yeah . Okay . Okay .
Industrial Designer : So I think this is the best of two worlds .
Project Manager : Okay , what about um {vocalsound} the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Because it it's of cour
Industrial Designer : Yes . It's it's {disfmarker} uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : It's very unlogical .
User Interface : {vocalsound} But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .
Project Manager : Well {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Well the there has to be some pointing at . But {disfmarker}
Project Manager : It depends also on your on your {disfmarker}
User Interface : Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just {vocalsound} to the other wall .
Project Manager : Well , it depends on your walls actually . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably {disfmarker} you're probably right .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um {disfmarker} yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .
Industrial Designer : All lights get absorbed , yeah . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So {vocalsound} it has an {disfmarker} it's easier . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip .
User Interface : And the regular chip .
Industrial Designer : I think uh it gives us the advantage of {disfmarker}
User Interface : And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yes , yes .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} I like the scroll wheels uh idea .
Industrial Designer : And uh skip {disfmarker} and skip the L_C_D_ part .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : I don't think it it's any uh value added thing .
User Interface : No . Think so too .
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Well , it looks {disfmarker} uh yeah , well um
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology ,
Industrial Designer : Technology .
Project Manager : and I mean L_C_D_";yes;4;yes;4;yes;2;yes;3;yes;2;no;0;yes;2
"User Interface : That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button .
Industrial Designer : Like this one .
User Interface : But uh we don't uh we don't uh {disfmarker} we do think it's um well {disfmarker} what if with ease of use , w which prefers the {disfmarker} which the the customer of the user prefers .
Industrial Designer : It's important . Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . But other users who are new to this device need something like that .
Project Manager : Okay .
Industrial Designer : They n they need to understand what {disfmarker} uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them
Project Manager : Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? A a and the voice recognition as well ,
Industrial Designer : Yeah , maybe so . Yes , it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager : th maybe you could uh could uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um {gap} . {vocalsound} There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah .
Industrial Designer : It's it's quite easy .
Project Manager : Okay . Okay , good . And and the case is is rubber ?
Industrial Designer : Yes , rubber ?
Project Manager : And the buttons ?
User Interface : {vocalsound} Plastic or rubber .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} There are plastic or rubber .
User Interface : Well ,
Project Manager : Okay ,
User Interface : yeah .
Project Manager : and uh the colouring ?
Industrial Designer : Uh yellow with uh
Project Manager : {gap} with with grey or black .
Industrial Designer : grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay ,
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : we'll we'll come to that later . Um
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : okay . Anything else to add or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : No . {vocalsound} Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} But {disfmarker}
Marketing : Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button ,
Industrial Designer : Yes , but it {disfmarker}
Marketing : 'cause you have to assign two channel {disfmarker} new channels .
Industrial Designer : but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think .
Project Manager : M uh yeah .
Industrial Designer : Or not ?
Project Manager : M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition .
Marketing : You {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Well okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that .
User Interface : And a button for disabling the voice recognition .
Project Manager : Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it {disfmarker} you'd disable it with a little beep and and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yes .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : but o okay , that that's not really really important .
User Interface : {vocalsound} That's the basic idea , yeah . Of our prototype .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : The basic {disfmarker} okay . Okay . Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ?
Marketing : Yes .
Project Manager : Okay .
Marketing : Uh my name is not name
Project Manager : {vocalsound} You are nameless . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : but {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Uh well , I used the {gap} {disfmarker} the uh {gap} documents . And these uh were the most important criteria .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Is it spongy ? {vocalsound}
Marketing : It should be . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah ,
Project Manager : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . Fancy look and feel . So {disfmarker}
User Interface : So just walk through it step by step . I mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} I believe uh I believe it's fancy . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Uh well appar
Industrial Designer : I believe it's fancy too .
Marketing : Yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet .
Project Manager : No .
User Interface : Oh , sorry .
Marketing : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Okay , so
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria .
Marketing : Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria .
Project Manager : Okay , well {disfmarker}
Marketing : So uh
Project Manager : the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing : that's about it .
Project Manager : The production costs . The costs are not under {disfmarker} Can I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um this is the {disfmarker}
User Interface : Twenty two .
Project Manager : Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty .
User Interface : Yikes .
Project Manager : And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . So I guess we should skip that ,
Industrial Designer : Well it's very expensive .
Project Manager : because it's not that important .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
User Interface : Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa
Project Manager : Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .
User Interface : yeah . The number of uh {disfmarker} yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay .
Project Manager : Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model . Um if you would {disfmarker}
User Interface : And and does it {disfmarker}
Project Manager : if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um {vocalsound} to make it {vocalsound} just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature ,
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price .
Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Yeah , I believe {disfmarker} Uh , push-button , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It makes it the thirteen {disfmarker} yeah . Push-buttons are {disfmarker} buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost .
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
Project Manager : So um {disfmarker} yeah , th this design is not um within our price model .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : But I'm afraid it's not complete . Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . And you have not added one item there .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So it's c way too expensive .
Project Manager : It's still too expensive , yeah . Um {disfmarker}
User Interface : But that's that's only for the buttons .
Project Manager : I I guess if we leave the {disfmarker} if we leave this one out , um {disfmarker}
User Interface : So the button we can use plastic .
Project Manager : oh . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : And uh maybe not use the special form .
User Interface : And the pla uh {disfmarker} And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber .
Industrial Designer : But it {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} It becomes a very dull remote control , I know .
Industrial Designer : Yes .
Project Manager : But it's the board decision . Um {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} yeah .
Industrial Designer : Well , b basically it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions .
Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah , I know . Maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} Type of m maybe another market segment .
Project Manager : Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic
Industrial Designer : Yeah .
Project Manager : and uh m maximise the profits
Industrial Designer : Yes .
Project Manager : and um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : That's {disfmarker} maybe that's better . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : but that's not what uh has been asked .
Project Manager : I know , I know .
Industrial Designer : So we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah . Although I think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already .
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
Project Manager : Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .
Industrial Designer : Yes .
Project Manager : Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no . {vocalsound} It's not that innovative .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Or however you s pronounce that .
User Interface : Yeah , too bad . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Um so , okay . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Oh ,
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : this is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign . {vocalsound} We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product .
User Interface : Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : Um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . I guess {disfmarker}
Marketing : Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah , that's true .
Industrial Designer : Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .
Project Manager : We l we can learn . Yeah . Yeah . I agree .
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Well {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Is it fancy ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager : I d it is it is {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing : Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : Yay . Is it ? Is it fancy ?
Project Manager : Yeah , I think so .
User Interface : Um the yellow rubber , I think so .
Industrial Designer : I think so .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} You like the rubber , uh Roo . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} I'm into it . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : So uh one ?
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : But it's not that fancy .
Project Manager : No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two .
Industrial Designer : I mean I think uh {disfmarker} I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing . It would be even more {disfmarker}
Project Manager : You like tita {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : That's a flavour as well .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : It has flavour . Yes , that's right . {vocalsound} You should taste it . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Right . Um {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah , I know ,
Marketing : Is it uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : It has to do with fashion , I guess .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : It's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : So do {disfmarker}
Marketing : And w
User Interface : yeah .
Marketing : yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : So in that way {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it's fancy .
Project Manager : It applies . It {disfmarker} yeah .
User Interface : Well , just {vocalsound} give it a two .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yes .
User Interface : It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : I think I th I think it would have been {disfmarker} I would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar .
User Interface : Yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three . So I believe uh we are close uh to two .
Industrial Designer : Yes .
Project Manager : Yeah , I I agree .
Industrial Designer : Yes , I agree too . It's okay . We did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good .
Marketing : Okay , and uh was it innovative ?
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Well ,
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : But that's not in it . Ov or can we {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yep .
Project Manager : No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype .
Industrial Designer : Well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product .
User Interface : Okay .
Industrial Designer : So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : {vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel . The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think .
Industrial Designer : No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , and uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager : That would have been a thrill .
Industrial Designer : yes , but {disfmarker}
Marketing : So uh also a uh two ?
Industrial Designer : I think uh it's a two .
Project Manager : Yep .
Marketing : Is it easy to use ?
Project Manager : I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure .
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users .
User Interface : I think {disfmarker} I think a three .
Industrial Designer : So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more .
Project Manager : Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing : Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .
Project Manager : Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions .
Industrial Designer : Okay .
Project Manager : It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ?
Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Okay .
Industrial Designer : After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Uh Roo , a three ?
User Interface : Yep .
Project Manager : Ruud ?
Marketing : Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two .
Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten .
Project Manager : So I could make it e easy ?
User Interface : If you make it a four it will be three in general .
Industrial Designer : So that's w No , two and a half .
User Interface : If he makes it a four . Not a three .
Industrial Designer : Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker}
User Interface : Darn . Nee .
Industrial Designer : Yes . {vocalsound}
Marketing : Hmm ? Huh ?
Project Manager : Roo . {vocalsound}
User Interface : A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No .
Marketing : Yeah . I yeah {gap} .
User Interface : A four and a three together .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Four ?
User Interface : Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ?
Marketing : Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : Two ?
Marketing : two , two , three {disfmarker}
Project Manager : No ,
User Interface : And a three ?
Project Manager : I haven't said anything yet .
User Interface : Nee . I know .
Marketing : No . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five .
Industrial Designer : Divided by four .
User Interface : Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : But I'm filling in a three .
Industrial Designer : That's not even {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : But that's not possible to fill in ,
Project Manager : Yes , it is .
Industrial Designer : so we have to round it . {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely .
User Interface : Yeah ,
Industrial Designer : Yes .
User Interface : we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .
Industrial Designer : It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy .
Project Manager : Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah .
User Interface : Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yes . Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker}
Project Manager : I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that .
Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah .
User Interface : But even without it {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Well , I uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : So , I th
Project Manager : we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one .
User Interface : Yeah .
Project Manager : Um Sebastian ?
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , me too .
User Interface : Me too .
Marketing : Yeah , I agree .
Project Manager : Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable .
User Interface : Was it one of our options ?
Industrial Designer : No , it's not one of our option ,
Marketing : No . Uh
Project Manager : No okay , but but
User Interface : So , in the in {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker}
Marketing : this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : for the options given , it's the most spongy one .
Industrial Designer : Uh yes ,
User Interface : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market .
Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : Yes , but it's not good enough ,
Project Manager : {vocalsound} I'll give it a one .
Industrial Designer : so it's a two .
User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one .
Industrial Designer : You take one ? What do you give it ?
Marketing : Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . {vocalsound}
Marketing : but {disfmarker} yeah .
Project Manager : Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time .
Marketing : Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation .
User Interface : It will be a one . {vocalsound}
Marketing : So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .
Industrial Designer : No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} You are {disfmarker}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : okay .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : The remote control offers enough features .
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ?
Marketing : Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable .
Marketing : Yeah , depends .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode .
Project Manager : Yeah , I know .
Industrial Designer : So it's quite advanced .
Project Manager : What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker}
User Interface : Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has .
Project Manager : I think it has .
Marketing : Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat
Project Manager : Yeah . Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So ,
Industrial Designer : Yes .
Project Manager : you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals .
Industrial Designer : Has uh the signals sent to it .
User Interface : Yeah .
Marketing : Signal .
Project Manager : So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to {disfmarker} as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features .
Industrial Designer : Absolutely .
Project Manager : Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced .
Industrial Designer : Yes . But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons .
Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple .
Project Manager : Yep .
Industrial Designer : You can use your voice to to programme it . It's {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the {disfmarker} for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .
User Interface : I'll give a two .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , I'll give it a one .
Marketing : Um I think think a one , 'cause {gap} v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yes . I I've {disfmarker} I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .
User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker}
Project Manager : So high quality , low acceptance .
Industrial Designer : Hmm .
Project Manager : The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . But {vocalsound} whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is {disfmarker} well , is not sure .
Industrial Designer : Yes . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
Project Manager : D do you agree ?
Industrial Designer : Yes , I agree . I {disfmarker}
Marketing : Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced .
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe we should have a radar uh {vocalsound} function . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay .
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes .
User Interface : But we could {disfmarker} couldn't uh {disfmarker} what what's the selling price ? Fifty ?
Project Manager : Twenty five Euros .
User Interface : Uh twenty five . And costs were twelve fifty .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : But even now , if only our production costs w {vocalsound} uh were exceeded the double , Think . Production cost was {disfmarker} were t uh was twenty two ?
Project Manager : Mm-hmm .
User Interface : So uh {gap} selling price uh would be uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : M about fifty Euros .
User Interface : yeah .
Industrial Designer : That's quite ex
User Interface : That's price , but w w
Industrial Designer : well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .
User Interface : No . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes .
User Interface : Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders .
Project Manager : Bu but {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros .
Industrial Designer : Yes . Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition
Project Manager : {gap} .
Industrial Designer : and this one does .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So I think it's worth its price .
Project Manager : Okay . Um you had an overall rating . Um {disfmarker}
Marketing : Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} with these ratings uh
Project Manager : That's counting .
Industrial Designer : Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that .
Marketing : should be about one point s seven ,
User Interface : Four six seven eight .
Marketing : yeah .
Project Manager : Okay .
User Interface : Nine divided by six .
Project Manager : Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . Um {disfmarker} What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? Ruud ?
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Try to translate that . {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer : Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound}
Marketing : {vocalsound}
User Interface : Hmm . {vocalsound}
Project Manager : Any any other {disfmarker} Uh , Roo ?
User Interface : Yeah , I think uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer : Well , I think {disfmarker}
Marketing : Ye
Project Manager : {vocalsound} Roo . {vocalsound}
User Interface : {vocalsound} The process was good .
Industrial Designer : {vocalsound}
User Interface : But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs .
Project Manager : Yeah .
User Interface : And and that was the the big deal . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made
Industrial Designer : Mm . Actually , we had {disfmarker}
User Interface : the the choice between {gap} what {disfmarker}
Project Manager : Better decision .
Industrial Designer : Yes .
User Interface : yeah .
Industrial Designer : We had we had too little information actually .
Project Manager : Yeah .
Industrial Designer : So {disfmarker} And uh um the the the {disfmarker} well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too {disfmarker} the the choice of components was way too narrow .
